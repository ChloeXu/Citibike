New feature|Path should have a feature of adding 2 pictures on one thought!|Version 4.3.2|5
This is was social should be|Path is focused on what matters. The moments and people in your life that matter.   The best social app available. I can always feel the amount of effort and energy the Path team puts into every design decision they make for Path.|Version 4.3.2|5
Connection to 8Tracks|Need to be able to share favorite playlists from 8tracks app.|Version 4.3.2|4
Slow opening photos|This used to be my go to app for sharing on all sorts of social media as my hub.  Recently it's time-consuming to even get the camera to open when taking a new photograph or using an existing one.  Why does it take so long?  It doesn't get better with any new releases.   Oh, and here's a novel idea. How about when I search the words "Cape Cod" the pictures and moments that I've shared from Cape Cod are presented to me? Path is one of the few apps on my phone I allow location services, obviously for no good reason.  When are you going to fix my Path?|Version 4.3.2|1
It replaces any other apps|If you are looking for an app enabling you to communicate with small groups privately, this app is the best one ever, I bet. I strongly recommend it since it also allows you to post different types of data e.g. photo video link and.. especially music! Awesome app.|Version 4.3.2|5
جميل|جداً رائع goooooood|Version 4.3.2|5
The perfect personal social network|I've always loved the Apple-esque design ethos that permeates Path. The devs and designers really place an emphasis on delighting and surprising their users.  Because they respect your privacy and don't inundate you with ads, Path is the perfect place to share with those whom you care for the most.|Version 4.3.2|5
Can't search names|It's a great app but needs to be updated I can't search my name and it won't load all moments.|Version 4.3.2|1
Important comment|I love this app but i have comment about inner circle i noticed mistake about path for my favoriate friend some comments i can't see in inner circle|Version 4.3.2|4
Great app but...|I love this app! It's almost like a social networking app that I saw in a TV show that I always wanted! Anyways, the only thing that would make it better, is to be able to tag people so they can see when you say something back to them in your comments like on Instagram. |Version 4.3.2|5
Use to Love Path :(|I have been using Path since Ver 1. I have pushed it on to all of my family and friends. However not very cool when no one uses it and the user base in general is micro.  I only check in on it from time to time. It still the app that FB and the others should be.|Version 4.3.2|2
Great|I LOVE PATH!|Version 4.3.2|5
No User Base..|Sadly as much as I like Path I can't really have one without any friends on and have stopped using it. Also from my previous reviews I think that Path lost a lot of what made it unique in the first place. I used it since version 1  1. Lower the friend limit to 150 (raising it just loses the point of a small community of real friends).   2. Integration: I don't think the app needs a separate app to message, it worked just fine before?  3. Desktop version   4. Share audio recording|Version 4.3.2|3
great app! but...|It is so difficult to search the diary recorded long before.|Version 4.3.2|1
Great app but too many updates|Great app but I feel like im updating this app every single day.|Version 4.3.2|4
Still!|Still no messaging app, still one star.  Because they separate it|Version 4.3.2|1
The Mist Beautiful Social Media Experience|I love Path, and although its adoption rate is slow, it's still fantastic for collecting memories and as a client to push updates for other more popular platforms like Twitter and Tumblr. Path is by far the best in every way, except for the adoption rate.|Version 4.3.1|5
Love love this|This app is amazing. Music, pictures and freedom to express yourself and document your journey thru life is simply  unique.|Version 3.2.2|5
S|I will love you more if I dont have to constantly see those grey squares. I barely can see what my friends posted.|Version 4.3.1|3
Last update|The last update isn't showing pictures on timeline, instead it display them Grey.|Version 4.3.1|1
Enh brnamj syy2|Jdaa|Version 4.3.1|1
Excellent replacement for Facebook|Great app to replace Facebook. If you're looking to have a nice network of friends and family, this app does a great job at updating status, comments, news, music and photos. Highly recommend.|Version 4.3.1|5
Another SN app - What? Why?|So many questions. Why such a big focus on emojis? Who cares what I'm watching on TV or listening to on the Radio... This App could be so much better. It has the bones just needs the right direction. I have the perfect idea that will make this app soar to the top 100 list. Find me on app if interested: Captainbob|Version 4.3.1|1
Still improving?|Path Search was a great feature that hasn't worked in months, when will this be fixed? Any new features coming? I love Path, but it seems to be stagnant with development.|Version 4.3.1|3
Great|✔️|Version 4.3.1|5
Not listed|There are some new songs/films that haven't listed yet|Version 4.3.1|3
The next update|The next update should have an editing button for fixing typo's and adding stickers|Version 4.3.1|5
There is a problem in adding friends!!|There is a problem to add friends or search for them needs to be resolved..  Thank you..|Version 4.3.1|5
Love Path|I would say the best interface out there. I love Path, a great app for your closest friends.|Version 4.3.1|5
Friends list|Why can i still see the accounts that i dont want to add anymore in my friends list?|Version 4.3.1|3
useful|i used it for sharing privately talking with my wife.  just sharing small talk not immediately feedback.   and it's very powerful utility for writing travel log.  when off-line, it works (it don't meant upload off-line status.)  writing log, uploading photos and others. it saved local with time stamps.  when you meet Wi-Fi, it uploads servers and sharing with your path friends.|Version 4.3|5
eğlenceli|Path çok sevdim ben seni ama şu arkadaş sayısı limiti en azından Facebook da olduğu gibi 5k olmalı. 500 kişi çok az.  şimdi mesajlaşma da var. her işe yarıyor tek uygulamada hepsi.|Version 4.3|2
Landscape Mode|Hi, please make a Landscape mode especially for iPhone 6 Plus.|Version 4.3|5
Problem with the last update !!!!!|Please release a new update soon to fix the common friends list it freezes the screen and force me to shot down the app and open it again !!!!|Version 4.3|1
Very good but want more...|It's very good and has a nice interface but would love more as well as bidirectional connectivity.|Version 4.3|5
Friends capacity|I love this app obviously ! But we need a lot of Friends capacity to add more friend to get more enjoy and social , with 500 limit that kills the purpose of it , think conscientiously PATH  please !!!!!!|Version 4.3|5
Can't share on Twitter|I don't know the hell happened why I can't share moments on twitter. I did a lot of times re-installing the apps (path&twitter) just to figure out what was wrong why I can't have the share access. It left me very disappointed to wait several hours to put the path on background while I click the connect link to twitter for it to be signed in. But then after hours it was still only a blank white background when it is supposed to be the sign-in page of twitter to connect moments from path. Ugh!|Version 4.3|1
Access Crash|I have a problem in accessing the app. whenever i try to open it, it crash.|Version 4.3|2
Suggestion !|We want VOICE THAUGHT. and some photos we share on path we want to let them can't save it ot if they will screenshot we want notification please!   It's perfect . And yeah we need secret 3 or 2 friends no one can see them on our lists .|Version 4.3|3
User since 2010|We use it to keep the family across the U.S. close. Best social media app by FAR! Would pay for this service. Don't listen to the "haters"|Version 4.3|5
Crashes a lot|Latest updates is making the app slow and crashes a lot.|Version 4.3|2
Fix the problems!!!|I am changing my review from 5 stars to 3 because the bugs are SO bad! The new update fixed one problem & but added new problems. Half the time, my feed won't load at all. And a lot of times I will get notifications that I have new comments or requests, but when I go into the app they are nowhere to be found. Fix the problems & I'll change my rating back to 5 stars. Also, I unfriended someone based on the stuff they were posting & they don't show up on my friends list, but their posts are still in my feed!!! What the heck! How do I get rid of them?!|Version 4.2|3
Where is the iOS 8 update?  They have arrived.|3/2/15 Thank you for adding extensions.  Great update!  11/18/14 The latest update is still missing the iOS extensions.  I am looking forward to your iOS 8 update.  Please add extensions that allow you to post directly from our camera roll.  Update 11/3/14:  Where are the iOS 8 extensions?|Version 4.3|5
Like it|Good for close family. Feel more comfortable putting up pics/videos of my kid versus Facebook.|Version 4.3|5
Best|Good|Version 4.3|5
dropdown to 1 star|on my i6, after update always restart. but for other apps, no problem. why just PATH, always restart my i6 after scroll down!!!!!!|Version 4.3|1
Amazing App!|Nice Jobs Path Team|Version 4.3|5
Allow location access "while using app"|Poor privacy setting implementation|Version 4.3|1
Nice update||Version 4.3|5
A great place for memories.|Looking for an app truly designed to be mobile, I found Path. I love it it's so personal and I can really share those memories with close friends.   Compared to the Facebook app this blows it out of the water. It was built with UX in mind and as well as design. Give it a try!  As a social network, it's great and not a meme center like Facebook has become.  -----------4.0 review-------- I've been using Path since 2.0.  I'm not sure what to say about the new one.  Had previously given it 5 stars, but separating it into two apps just doesn't make sense.  I'm giving it a 3.|Version 4.3|3
|Very nice program and easy to use, and combines many of the features I advise everyone by|Version 4.2|5
khalil||Version 4.3|5
Like it||Version 4.2|5
Nearly Perfect|Love the stickers. Anyway that the share extension can inherit the social network posting? I'd love to share from the extension to social networks.|Version 4.3|5
No User Base|I love Path, but the user base isn't there.  I've had limited success with getting other friends to use it.  And you can't use a social network alone.  I love the fact that you see everything, and it's in chronological order.  It's simple, clean and well designed.  I don't know what it would take to make Path a major player, without changing what Path is.  And I don't want Path to change what it is.  Going from a mobile only service to a desktop service, also, might help.  I would like to see sharing to Instagram.  Just advertising in general would help.  How many non tech people have heard of Path?  Just whatever you do, don't become Facebook.  I hate Facebook with a passion.  It's a mess and privacy is nonexistent.  (Update, I have quit Path.  It's dead, and as I mentioned before, I can't use it alone.)|Version 4.3|5
Old moments|Path wouldn't be the coolest app ever until I can search through every single moment I wrote. Fix it ASAP, please.|Version 4.2|3
Most reviews are fake|I suspect most reviews here are fake. Let's face it, Path is ok. It's neither great, nor terrible. Just meh. They tried and they failed to become the next Facebook (probably because FB finally got their act together with respect to mobile). Deleting this app; thanks for trying and good luck in your next startup.|Version 4.2|2
Not all TV titles searchable|Why aren't all TV titles on here? For instance, just searched for "Togetherness," a show on HBO, and no go. What's the deal?  Lots of oversights in the media section to be honest .|Version 4.2|2
we want more future & laaaaaaag|update |Version 4.2|1
Doha|It's amazing we can talk with our friends and see were they are and what they do|Version 4.2|5
Practically perfect|A beautiful social network/journaling app that has become the hub for my family. My data isn't sold to advertisers, and I can control who I share each post with.  I would rate it 5 stars (again), but they interrupted my use of the app to beg for a rating.|Version 4.2|4
Love this app. 2+ years with this app|Simply the best!  Looking for a Facebook alternative to share with just real friends and family?  This is the one.|Version 4.2|5
Problem|I have a problem with videos and photos being upload reallly slow   Please help|Version 4.2|1
Still needs some features|Game moments please  I asked u before but no updates about that so please add video games moments !!|Version 4.2|3
Great but need huge improvement on media aspect|Pretty good app, but seriously need upgrading on the speed of the app especially to load and see / play pictures and videos on the feed. Be great to have a better and more improved control and creative allowance on the filters as well. But speed is the serious issue here.|Version 4.2|2
Question.|I lost my email address password, and I can't log into my Path. I was wondering could you install a "Connect To Facebook" link? Thanks.|Version 4.2|3
Elegance in a social app|This app rocks. It's simple to use, gorgeous, and definitely the best social app for iOS out there.|Version 4.2|5
So amazing|A PERFECT APP!!!|Version 4.2|5
PLEASEEE REAAAAAD|This app is like the best social media app. I am on it 24/7 !! I have the version that you dont have to download the talk app to message tour friends and i love it! I heard that the latest version doesnt have the "seen by", which kind of let me down, thats why i am definitely NOT looking forward to update the app to sum up: install this app, its worth it!|Version 4.2|5
Hiding some friends moments|Please consider making a feature for hiding moments by others that I don't want to see. Because some of my friends could post something that I done like to see every now and then but at the same time I don't want to unfriend them.|Version 4.2|4
||Version 4.2|5
I love Path|Beautiful design, lovely features and smileys. I love using Path as a personal journal.|Version 4.2|5

TV SERIES!!|I love that Path now has a new to post - TV SERIES!! but there are some TV series that my friends could find but not for me.. for examples,CSI and Masterchef Junior US.. is there any differences between my path and my friends'?? thank you|Version 4.2|3

It's better than Instagram|Ok. My friend told me to get this last night, I got it and I love it!! Path is a fun social media app to have because it's easier to manage than like Facebook or Instagram or Twitter ect.|Version 4.2|5
Woooow|مدمنته|Version 4.2|5
Makkah|الباث حلو بس يعلق كثير ويحذف الثوتات|Version 4.2|5
So much better than Facebook|Love, love, love this app. Perfect way to stay in touch with family and close friends and avoid the fuss of Facebook. This has been a perfect way to share pictures of our little ones.|Version 4.2|5
App Stole my IAPs. :-(|Well that's just great. Installing the newest update lost my previously purchased IAPs totalling about $30 for various stickers and photo filters, and using the "Restore Purchases" button does absolutely nothing.  Since the whole "We're going to steal your contacts list" debacle, I don't necessarily trust Path as a developer and I've been with them since November of 2010. This latest development of them stealing all the items I paid for doesn't exactly make things better, so I think it's time to completely move my social efforts over to Ello.|Version 4.2|1
I love path but|There is a problem in the path, I can not find some of the songs, and does not work very well, and I hope that you return Attention visit, and listen to the song. I apologize to my English, thank|Version 4.2|3
Great app|Perfect for keeping in touch w/ your family.   They have some server issues but its not terribly inconvenient.   Great app.|Version 4.2|5
Path was great until I lost my purchases|I bought stickers few months ago and after the update I lost it !! And if I want to reinstall it I have to buy it again?? Are you crazy?? Yes.|Version 4.2|1
I like Path but the Messaging !|WHY IS THE MESSAGING A SEPARATE APP??? please put it back on the application so it is more convenient and saves more space!|Version 4.2|2
Terrible|this is the worst update I've ever  experienced! bought scamps stickers and they're gone. I want my money back. so stupid to trust this app!|Version 4.2|1
Path is the best|Best application ever made. Keep it going.|Version 4.1|5
They do social well|Like this app a lot and have used for awhile. It's great and easy way to keep up to date with family and friends without the worry of fiddling with settings to make sure you know who can see what. It provides a great searchable timeline of what you've done which is fun to look back on.   Great app.|Version 4.1|5
SO Much Potential|I have now uninstalled and ceased using this app. This is the first time that I've actually been very sad to part with an app. It is so beautiful, and has so much potential. Unfortunately, the marketing behind path and a few decisions along the way, such as limiting the number of friends one can have, severely handicapped its potential. I hope the marketing team can resurrect Path for 2015.|Version 4.1|4
Needs More Popularity!|This app would be fun if more people were involved. Otherwise, it'll boring with nobody but yourself.|Version 4.1|4
Path|I ❤️ this app  Best photo sharing app|Version 4.1|5
Ffffvbj|Vhygkk|Version 4.1|5

It could be a lot better..|Bring the visits back!! |Version 4.1|3
Great App!|I love the most recent update, but one thing I would like too see is a new feature for Path for friend request. Some friends do not accept the request in time enough, so the requests start too build up. Instead of removing each friend request who has not accepted, one by one, (which can take some time in order too accept another one) can a feature be adjusted for Path too removed those request. If that feature can be made, that would be Awesome!|Version 4.1|5

The worst thing ever!|I love path. I have a lot of friends in there, but there'e that one thing that's really horrible about this app. When someone tags me, I can't remove it! Why is that? There're people who tag me and I don't know them! They keep talking and talking for like over a week!! Why can't I remove myself if I get tagged!?|Version 4.1|2

FAVORITE❤️|i use this everyday to just post anything & everything, my own little personal path, super rad✨ good filters, easy layout so fun|Version 4.0.3|5
UGH!!|I liked path better when it was limited friends (150) and it showed who visited your page!|Version 4.0.3|1
I can't post anything!|Nobody can see all my posts,comments and all my activities on my path. Why?? Please fix it immediately!!!.|Version 4.0.3|1
Exciting|Nice app|Version 4.0.3|5
Best app ever!!|My secret place.|Version 4.0.3|5
Please allow to support GIFS|It would be a 5 star if gifs are supported.Gifs are fun to share. Please allow this app to share gifs among friends. Thanks!|Version 4.0.3|4
Potentially great app…|I hanged my rating from 5 stars because I dislike that Now I need 2 applications instead of 1 to use all of the features. I also made in-app purchases which have been removed and I am prompted to re-purchase them. It's so sad that such a great app that stood apart from other social media apps is starting to lose its appeal.|Version 4.0.3|1
Great! But!|It is a great social app but I have an iPhone 6 plus and it does not support it. I just need an update and I would be prefect!|Version 4.0.3|4
My|Kereeen|Version 4.0.3|3
Great when it works correctly|If this app didn't have bugs, I would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, there are too many times when a post is posted, but no one can actually see it. It seems to happen every day or two. There are only five people in my little group, and we have all experienced this.|Version 4.0.3|2
Stickers scrolling doesn't work on iPhone 6!!!|Why the stickers which I bought cannot be scrolled through on iPhone 6 plus!!|Version 4.0.3|1
Path update is highway robbery|This last update eliminated all the icons I purchased & expects me to re-purchase them! Thief! I'd give the app one star but for the fact that I use this app to communicate with family & very close friends. Totally PO'd. Shame on you, Path!|Version 4.0.3|2
Can't live without it|My secret place to record all the details of my life. Good filters and simple interface. Good social network app. Probably the best ever! Love it!|Version 4.0.3|5
Can't delete friends|I give path 1 star because I can't delete friends , and when I go down in my TL it shows the moments I made not one from the time before. And no I'm not on my page it's my time line and it's being really dumb. Main reason why I don't get on it that much .|Version 4.0.3|1
one of the best|5|Version 4.0.3|5

Love it|Great app, I absolutely love it. I've been using it for a year now! But there's a little complain there is no block button and when I unfriend someone they can still send me message and tag me and it's really bothering cause some people need to be blocked, I also like that you removed the visited your path. Please bring back how many friends you have and remove the deleting messages after 24 hours xx|Version 4.0.3|4
Fix This Are Lose A Member|everytime i post a sratus on path it disappears from my timeline fix fis problem please are im going bck to Facebook|Version 4.0.3|1
Useful for families and close friends|Path provides tools to share status updates with /actual/ friends.  The design is modern and playful, and the features are less annoying than other social networks.   Keep it to a small group of your closest friends or family. You'll be surprised at how your connections with each other bloom.|Version 4.0.3|5
Duplicate notifications with Talk|Since Path doesn’t provide support requests I’m doing this here:  using both Path and Talk apps produces duplicate notifications for messages in Talk. My phone notifies me twice for every message I receive, one from each app. I’ve checked both settings and nothing seems to work save for turning the notifications off entirely.  Must fix.|Version 4.0.3|4
Visit|Bring (visited your path) back|Version 4.0.3|3
Share problem|I can't share or connect path with tumblr Please fix it|Version 4.0.3|1
Simple, Easy To Use, Personal|This is the best app I've found so far and Path is the answer to the complex social media era. It's interface is extremely simple, and it starts to do the thinking for you after "getting to know you" super cool! You'll have to try it out and get to know Path!|Version 4.0.3|5
Lost premium subscription!|I'm giving Path two stars only because I've paid 6.99$ for the 3 months premium subscription which worked for a day only! Tried contacting the developers but no one is answering me !|Version 4.0.3|2
Gooodd|Gooooddd|Version 4.0.3|5

I WANT THE VISIT BACK|I really dont get why u guys removed the visit ur path notification pleaseee  seriously though we really liked that!! And also we want to delete old messages in path!! Other than that path's perfect❤️|Version 4.0.3|3
Fix the notification|It will notify me of moments after a while of posting it, moments disappear from the timeline. It is irritating|Version 4.0.3|4
This new ui is terrible.|Bring my old path back pls.|Version 4.0.3|1
Visited your Path!|No, why you removed *visited your Path* notification :( we liked this in Path|Version 4.0.3|3
Deleted reviews?|Recent rumor has it that Apple is buying Path.  May be true considering Apple has deleted the previous 6 months of comments, which were all negative since there have been no updates.  Download the app with a grain of salt.  Really like Path and would like to see more effort put into it, or sell it to Apple.|Version 4.0.3|1
What about compatible for iPhone 6 plus|??|Version 4.0.3|4
Ffs|Older version is much better|Version 4.0.2|1
Great app, put messages back in|Really enjoy this app. I use it with my whole family. Didn't like that they removed messages, but keeping the 5 stars because it's an excellent app.|Version 4.0.2|5
visitation|why did yal take the visitation notifications away? that is the only way I knew what was going on with people I love and share with and they knew I care because of the visits , give back the visitation|Version 4.0.2|3
A private place|I guess I've been lucky, I'm not having any of the issues others are having on my iPad or iPhone. My two wishes though would be that 1) the camera snapped faster and 2) better stickers, I don't relate to any of them, especially if that's what your using to entice people to contribute to help keep the site ad free. I paid anyway because I think privacy is worth something.|Version 4.0.2|5
Good but not the best |I got Path yesterday because my friend recommended me to get it. I read a few of the reviews and saw not many people are enjoying the update. It doesn't have the best features that other social medias have. Could use some work.|Version 4.0.2|3
|For more than 2 months now the friend list problem is not fixed yet and since IOS8 came out the app keeps crashing randomly and also I can't view media on path talk it's not loading :/ so can you kindly hurry up with the update with these bug fixes  Thank you|Version 4.0.2|1
I hate it|I hate the new update and talk message I wish we had the old version |Version 4.0.2|1

Bug bug bug|Please fix|Version 4.0.2|1
I love path|This the best thing ever happen to belle glade put could you please let us know when people visit you again that was the best feature man|Version 4.0.2|5
Saweet|Dislike the parting ways of a separate messaging app. Completely nonsense seeing as how it doesn't have much else to offer than before; it doesn't deem a stand alone app if it's not filled with extra "messaging" benefits. Path itself is great though; I just think it's a nonsense move to split the two. ******* Finally, glad to see the parallax effect for banner photos!  ********** Don't know why they removed the fun feel for the "shop"; now it's what? listed? Grand.   Not too fond of how the profile's banner photo gets dimmed after uploading a picture. Not a good route, nor necessary.  *********** Love the beautiful photo filters that are for both pictures and video. BUT, could be better at full resolution. Please add a selection in settings on what quality/size per photo and video to be saved/captured as. The filters are great but when uploaded to a website the quality looks more on the compressed side; please add full resolution/high quality option to be saved to camera roll.  ********** Love Path more than Facebook, but the last update screwed around with the music tagging feature. It worked flawlessly before the update and after this new update to include movies and books, the music tagging has failed every time and everyday I try to use it. Please get it fixed!  ****update***** Thank you for fixing the music tagging. Not too happy I lost some of my posts/videos randomly. They never came back.  Other than that one random mishap, I still really like path. I would like to suggest movie or show tagging by "listening", like how the music can listen and tag.|Version 4.0.2|5
The New Facebook?|This app has a beautiful interface, easily manageable format, and few worries about privacy. One drawback is the two-app system, one for Path itself and one for the messaging system. Overall, I would recommend it if you want a private, easy way to share with close friends and family.|Version 4.0.2|4
Minus a star for "not happy/rate 5 stars" dialog.|If you want real feedback, let all of it end up here, not just the five star ones.  The app itself is pretty, great for sharing with the dozen people I care about, and no constant changing of the privacy rules and behaviors.  And no "I scored 92 in CandyFarmCrushville!" rubbish.|Version 4.0.2|3
Love it!!!|My friends and I use this to keep in touch no matter where we all are. And having an inner circle to post only to my closest friends is great.|Version 4.0.2|5
It WAS good|The thing is we all loved path as it used to be, we had it all in one place! Now from an app to another.. I gotta check my timeline in a place and talk to people in another, which is a stupid idea! When are you going to fix this? When's the next update?|Version 4.0.2|1

Simple, private, beautiful sharing|Path is great and I love seeing more of my friends hop on. Path and Path Talk do a lot of great stuff no one else does, and I don't have to worry about what advertisers are doing with my data this week because there aren't any. It's actually private. Get it.|Version 4.0.2|5

I love Path.|I deleted Facebook a few months ago and started using Path with my closest friends and family only. It's a simpler, more private social platform with a beautiful app and no ads. Love it.|Version 4.0.2|5
Good but app split too?|What's up with the trend of splitting apps? I thought Path would be anti-trend.   I am new to Path but I like its approach and being ad free and giving users more controls in an intuitive way. It doesn't seem to be a place for sharing news though. I guess it is a decided attitude.|Version 4.0.2|4
No deal!|I will never in my life give my phone number to a web service or application! I don't understand why I MUST give it to you in order to register and use the app.|Version 4.0.2|1

old is gold|i dont love the new path an talk app|Version 4.0.2|1
The old one is better.|The last update wasn't that good. I liked the old one more. It was special now it reminds me of other apps. And it always crashes when I see my friends. Please fix it. And get rid of the "talk" app we want the old path back. The last thing we want is to apps for the same social network and both of them have difficulties in the friends thingy.. Sometimes it shows that I have friends that I don't know nor have. And then it lags and crashes. So PLEASE fix it in the next update.|Version 4.0.2|1
Sad|I used to like the old path but after having two apps, which is kinda silly, I am disliknkg it  Its hard to deal with two apps and it takes time. I wish you just do a one app with the dm|Version 4.0.2|1
Yuck|I love path but the new update is ugly (it looks like every other app ) and the chat thing is rather pointless so I didn't download either |Version 3.4.2|3
Features wanted|Hi there,, Thanks for this a fantastic social network , but we still need a missing features like:  - filter our thoughts by date (week, month, year) by time wheel or any appropriate means - develop the search engine to be more efficient and accurate. - the able to download our thoughts and moments as a bulk single file like twitter and Facebook archive.  Regards,,|Version 4.0.2|4
FAKE ACCOUNTS|There's a lot of fake accounts on here. I been on path for years and I just deleted . I was bullied on there for years . This app should be ban !  Don't download this app !|Version 4.0.2|1
Deleting moments|This app is the popular on my phone! It's the only one that I use everyday! But I wonder why the number of moments is not decreasing when I delete some of them?|Version 4.0.2|5
Social media|Good|Version 3.4.3|4
Old one|The old version better than the new .. My friends remove the app after the new apdate |Version 4.0.2|1
Great for private sharing|Facebook, Instagram, Foursquare are vanity and entertainment platforms. Path allows me to share my private life with close friends and family. I don't need to worry about over sharing or privacy. What's on Path stays on Path.  Unfortunately there are issues with the app. It doesn't get the same love and attention it used to get. The search bar is weirdly positioned when looking at search results. The search results do not show private posts. Posting with a shaky internet connection sometimes leads to posts being invisible to my friends. They had issues with notifications. The list goes on. It was such a great product. There is no alternative to Path.  Please Path get with the program. Either shut it down and do chat. Or continue with making Path great. Don't do both only half.|Version 4.0.2|4

Big problem|Application not accessible with voiceover|Version 4.0.2|1
Not pleased anymore!|I've been using path for over 2 years now and still not pleased. I was kinda happy when you guys added the pm feature. Then you took it away....  I don't see the point anymore.  Ok, I can add more friends without a limit... But I can't private chat with them within the app? "C'Mon son"!!!   And also, This app should be more open to hashtags. What's the point if you can only see yourself & previous post with the same hash. Get it together. This app would be wonderful if you guys just add little simple features to it. You def not winning right now! This app isn't even really known about and it should be. It's a great app. Just missing too many minor features. Please fix ASAP!|Version 4.0.2|2

Path|Keren|Version 4.0.2|5
We want the old path back|Instead of advancing the app to make it easier you just made it worse. We want it back as a one app.|Version 4.0.2|1
Great Social Networking App|Path is the best social network app on the market. The removal of messaging within the app and creating a new separate app for it has been a disappointment because it is taking more space on an already small screen and taking more memory on a phone with limited space. Otherwise, it would be 5-star app.|Version 4.0.2|3
Path|I Love Path, another update please...  It's all about Friends, I can't see another friends when I have unshared 1 Person or just viewing.  I always force close the Path on My iPhone and back to Friends again.  Please... I want Path be better. |Version 4.0.2|5

HATE the new update and talk msg|Seriously the best thing about path was it had convo and peoples updates and location and whatever they wanted to share in one spot, added an app called talk makes it ridicules ! No one like having 2 apps for the same freaking social network ..  Instead of making it easier and improving the original app u guys made it harder and very annoying closing one app to jump to the other ! It makes u lose battery faster this way and its very annoying  .. Im sorry but i like the old path this one is awful hope u get back to ur original app and just improve it and not make it crappy  Plus ! I think path should have what show u watching not just movies and songs and books .. There is shows|Version 4.0.2|1

♡[τ̲̅н̲̅a̲̅и̲̅κ̲̅ ч̲̅o̲̅u̲̅]♡|Really, this last update is totally awesome  but I didn't give 5 stars because first, when I open the app first, it returns me back to my home screen, and the app is being minimized. Second, the chat is being separated with the app. What's so good about them being separated? LoL|Version 4.0.2|4

|app|Version 4.0.2|5
Hope it lasts|I still use Path everyday with 15 of my family members. We never used it to chat so I don't care about the app split. Although I still think it's silly.  I feel like Path is stagnating and with more attention being diverted to their chat app, I doubt Path will last much longer.|Version 4.0.2|4
Somebody DO something!|My biggest complaint about the "Original" Path app was it's lack of alerts from one user to another. My wife wouldn't know if I sent her a  pic or a message (which was actually us using the "Comments" feature  as a workaround for messaging) unless she had the phone in use at that moment.  Strangely, if the original Path had a proper alerts feature I wouldn't even mind having BOTH Path and Talk. But these two really should be combined.  If for no other reason than to have Talk's alert capabilities and Path pic posting together on ONE of these apps. That would be a 5 star app. But right you have two 2 star apps.|Version 4.0|2

Confused|It looks like more are unhappy with this app, than happy. I want to know why this app needs my phone number to start an acct. I don't give my number out. Shouldn't have to.|Version 4.0|1

The Stupidest App Update Award this year goes to...|The separation of direct message from the main app is simply stupid! Why would I want to have two apps in my iphone that should be able to coexist as one? Waste if space. Then, having a chat feature at an app that will send me to another app? Ridiculous! Even the lame facebook app does this better!  This update is really lame. Path is simply confused whether they want to be better than facebook or to be a competitor for whatsapp, line, etc. It USED TO be a good app, but not anymore. For those, who give pisitive ratings, I really don't understand how you use this app! If I could, I would give zero star for this lame app!|Version 4.0|1
Block option|Please make us a block option please|Version 4.0|3
CEO of #BNFC #BNFC_ID|Nice application, and easy to use. ;o) #Sir_Kiki|Version 3.3|5
UGH|It's a good app but it's moving so slow and isn't uploading all of my moments . And the notifications come late . FIX IT PLEASE|Version 4.0|3
Path to nowhere|Path is no longer fun, this app has become a pure headache it always freezes and doesn't load correctly.|Version 4.0|3
Photos for next update|Can the devs please in the next update make it so that photos can ONLY be uploaded directly through camera. I'm Indonesian and I can't stand how Indonesians use Path and the repath feature for uploading pictures from the internet. Path should be about real "moments" not internet "memes". Please, as soon as possible. Thank you. Overall, this an ok app but I'm getting pretty sick of all my friends misusing it.|Version 4.0|3
The new version is bad|We want the old one!|Version 4.0|1
Stupid|Who ever is the owner of this app needa get they stuff together cause I am sick of it messing up twitter never had this problem so get it together woe|Version 4.0|1
THE BEST|Great ✌️|Version 4.0|5
Why did you change|I don't understand why they had to completely change the interface when it was fine the way it was? And why is the chat feature now it's own app??|Version 4.0|2
Sweet family friendly app|I love this app, it's great for families, simple to use, and works very smoothly. I love that it's private and you have control on who you share with. I wish the Talk app was included with the Path app together. Overall I love it.|Version 4.0|5
So sick|I want the old path please :(|Version 4.0|1
Down the wrong path|Hate the latest update. I thought path would never be like those companies that sell out on their users just to try and compete with the rest of the social networks. I downloaded the app for the sole purpose of keeping in touch with the important people and path for some time was the perfect private social network. With the latest update I feel truly disappointed and might as well make a secondary Facebook account with only my closest friends. I hope that all the nice little features will make a comeback and be the great experience it once was. I only regret getting premium without knowing the changes that would be made to the service.|Version 4.0|1
Nice SocMed|I like this!!|Version 3.2.2|5
Go0od|Go0od|Version 4.0|5
Last update|I hate it! Everything is great except messaging and they need to update their path talk cus u cant send to a friend that is not on ur list!|Version 4.0|3
The new update|The new update is awful !! Really I didn't like it !|Version 4.0|1
review|so bad :(|Version 4.0|1
The worst update ever!|I hate the fact that the chat is not in the same app. I also hate the fact that you guys delete my messages after two days. I have downgraded to older version and I will never update.|Version 4.0|1
I can't believe it DID NOT get better!|It used to be an absolutely beautiful and complete way to feel involved with what you and your loved ones ARE doing! Great replacement for Facebook/Instagram and gateway to post to other networks. New UI halted me from upgrading my first iPhone app ever. Separate Talk app is a smart business move, but your original integrated implementation should remain as well; at least in the iPad version. Make Path slick and whole again, please!|Version 3.4.3|1
Problem!|I really you guys should come up with another updated, because nun of my notifications are showing up in my activity tab.|Version 4.0|1
I find the new UI unclear|Just a little bar at the bottom makes me sick. Please, make it appear no more!|Version 4.0|2
not happy with the update|I really hate the new update and I want the old path back!! the path talk is just so silly and its copying facebook!! please we need the old version back|Version 4.0|1
|Path is Good |Version 4.0|5
❤️❤️|I loved ❤️|Version 4.0|5
Absolute hate the new version|Please bring the old version back it was much better i'mm now considering deleting mu account|Version 4.0|1
New update|Notifications are not pushed through and an additional messenger app seems like a waste of data usage.|Version 4.0|1
Moment|How to delete moment in new path updated|Version 4.0|5
Nice|I love this app|Version 4.0|5
Jordan|Good|Version 4.0|5
Love It!|I love this app so much! It's better than other social networks because you can post pictures, messages, and more! It keeps me in touch with my friends from a different state too! I just love it!!!!! However, I don't like how the messaging is now a different app. I liked it a lot better when you could message people from the app itself. Otherwise it's amazing!|Version 4.0|5
Path|Didn't do the update thanks to god.... Poor who updated it  ❤️|Version 4.0|5
We want the old path back|No one is happy with the new update. Is there a way we can reinstall the old version??|Version 4.0|1
The recent version is desperate! I used to like the old Path!|I've been using Path for like 3 years now, I USED TO love it until the recent update ruined it!  1. It's just another Facebook which I hate! I liked this app because it was so unique and different.  2. "Talk" as a separate app (AND THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS MESSAGES) is just pointless!  3. How dare you deleted ALL our messaging history?!?! I don't want to and don't have the space on my phone for another app to chat! Path was cool with it's messaging system all in one! I miss some certain information that I had in my messaging section!  I thought Path was different! So disappointed now!|Version 4.0|1
Bug?|I've had this app for years now and it was whatever. Some of my friends had it, then everyone got over it. I kept it around because it had my favorite photo filters. With the new update I can't log in, I can't create a new account, and this isn't the first time my account has seemingly vanished. Not that I care about my account (I hardly use it) I just want to use your filters. Lol.|Version 4.0|1
Love it|The app is always amazing, and im enjoyin' it|Version 4.0|5
This app has taken a nose dive!|Path was once my favorite social app. It was user friendly, had an amazing user interface, and it made sharing photos, videos, messages, fun.  Over the last 12 months and with every "update" this app has steadily taken a nose dive. The service is unreliable and the app is bloated and gimmicky.  In the latest update, they removed the message/chat feature, and blatantly  deleted previous chat archives without warning. WOW!!!  They are now forcing users to download a separate messages app. to compete with WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.  I find the messaging app completely useless. A complete waste of time.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Original review from a year ago:  Hands down the best designed social app in the world.  A place to share your thoughts, photos, videos, music with your friends and family.  Interface is nothing like you have ever seen or experienced before. It's lightening fast, smooth as silk and has NEVER crashed on me!   Finally a compelling reason to opt-out of Facebook.|Version 4.0|1
Fantastic Application!|This app is seriously one of the best apps I've used in a long time! This app almost wants to make me delete my Facebook. This app is beautifully designed and laid out, and the fact that you can share your "moments" on other networks is quite affective. I recommend this to anyone because I want more of my friends to use it.|Version 4.0|5
Not so fast to refresh feed|Please upgrade the newest path app.  Sometimes it's not working good while i got to refresh the feeds on 3G mode.  So late|Version 4.0|3
this update is f**kd up|old one please|Version 4.0|1
⭐️|path is great if you wanna vent your feelings to absolutely no one|Version 4.0|5
Devolution|Dislike the deconstruction of micro features.|Version 4.0|1
Tv Shows|I would like to have the option to post the tv shows that Im watching..|Version 4.0|5
Worst update |We don't want another app to direct message, pls make update and include message in the main path app. Worst update, remove talk message.|Version 3.4.3|1
Elegance, where did you go?|Dear Path,  I just convinced my closest friends and family to join after telling them how different Path was. Simple, elegant, private. Then this update comes out, and it is pure hideousness: it's confusing, now requires a an equally annoying separate app for messaging, and it even deleted all past conversations without warning.   You made me not only distrust you, I don't think I like you. You made me a fool in front of those I love the most.   I have a hope, you can fix this.   Love,  Me.|Version 4.0|2
Bad|I cant log in, bad version ever  Path talk unavailable on ipad, oh come on. I cant send massager.|Version 4.0|1
Are u kidding????!!!!|1: it deleted my account.  2: when I made myself another account (and that was when I figured out there was an update) I friended some of my friends that I had before but when they friended me back it wouldn't let me send messages to my friends! It said I had to get "path talk" and when I pressed on that it led to App Store! Why do u have to message them on another app!  3: it's totally copying Facebook, so if u have a Facebook account u practically have two Facebooks! I liked path because it didn't look like Facebook! It had its own style, but now it's totally copying Facebook!! Which is STUPID!!!  4: it's much more confusing>:-(  5: it deletes your messages after 24 hours!!!!! Isn't that STUPID?!?!??  6: it's SUPER slow!  I used to be a HUGE fan of Path, I used to give it 5 stars, but now I'm giving it one star for deleting my account and for this update!!!! Don't get it!!!! You'll delete it five minutes after. Plz change it back to its normal looks.   Sincerely, me|Version 4.0|1
New update release|I love this app. It's easily one of my favorites, and I like it better than Facebook. That being said, a couple if things on the latest release:  1. I really dislike the menu bar cluttering up the bottom. Bring back the corner "spin out" menu, and stick that stuff back in side drawers. One of the best things about the functionality of this app was the clean interface. The clutter doesn't help. At least give me a way to hide it.  2. It would be great if there were a way at the end of the year to print an album of all the moments.|Version 4.0|1
Bas bad|Its very bad to use we need the old path please please|Version 4.0|1
Great alternative/complimentary to FB|Great app! We love this option as a family alternative to Facebook|Version 3.4.3|4
No like the update!|Why did u guys split it into two apps? Emmm not convenient at all -_-|Version 4.0|2
Return the old path update|We don't like the new update because it's deferent and harder than the old on we can't us to it and we have to download a program for the message and we don't like that so pleas return it for all of us thank you for understanding|Version 4.0|5
|The worst update everwe need the old it was perfect and simple than this |Version 4.0|1
الله يقلع الي مزين التحديث|رجعوا الاول|Version 4.0|1
:(|i don't like the new version|Version 4.0|1
Path talk|Aduh ini Bakrie malah misahin fitur messaging jadi aplikasi terpisah.. Jadi ribet..|Version 4.0|2
Epic Fail|With each update, Path keeps losing its quality.  The latest update was a terrible terrible decision!|Version 4.0|1
Worst update ever !|I can't see some of my friend moment after this update!|Version 4.0|1
New Messaging App|No I will not be downloading your new messaging app.  The last thing I want or need on my phone is another messaging app.|Version 4.0|1
Progress|I'm glad to see Path take a new direction after the departure of a key designer. However, I feel that with this update Path is no longer marching to the beat of a different drummer; something that was crucial in helping Path carve out its own identity in already crowded social media landscape.  There's a lot to like in this upgrade, but I feel that the cost, paid in the blood of a sacrifice of identity, is just to high to justify.|Version 4.0|3
Old day was good..|I loved Path. But not anymore... It's not beautiful among other great iOS 7 apps, UX is getting worse, and don't understand the separated chat app. It seems Path has lost their own path. Sad..|Version 4.0|1
Path|I think path is a good idea to communicate family and friends|Version 4.0|5
I Used to Love You, But...Boo...Hiss!!|Ahh - Boo...Hiss!  The old format was much better.  Two apps now...really?  And no mic for song recognition - Booo!  This WAS my favorite app for staying in touch, and I use MULTIPLE social media apps.  Erasing all old messages so no message history...Hisss!  Invest in larger servers, don't tell us it's about our privacy.  Why not give your users the option to erase our messages if we feel the need??  Please take the "Path" back to the other format!|Version 4.0|1
Promptly deleted after trying the new update|The new update kept putting notifications in may way (about new features, Talk, etc.) instead of letting me use the actual App. After fighting my way through the notifications I found the app running more slowly, with less functionality (no messages? why?), and with a UI design that looked like a compromise.  There was a lot to like about Path before this update, but I've deleted it and won't be using it again.|Version 4.0|2
سيئ جداً|ما اعجبتني فكرة التطبيقين للباث |Version 4.0|1
Has been...|I haven't used Path for about six months now. I still have the app though because I like the Nike integration. But after the last update I thought I might start actively using it again. Probably not now. The messaging has been moved to a separate app and the design seems like it has taken a step backward. I loved the ONE little button that controlled everything. And the swiping from side to side to reach the other menus.|Version 4.0|1
Great update|Thanx, great app. But iPad version of message app would be great!|Version 4.0|5
No notif after update|Update not make it better, even worst then before...notification show when path is open|Version 4.0|1
Very disappointing!!!|Bottom bar takes too much space. Splitting to another chat app is a bad idea. Why change droplet sound?  The new one is strange.  Please return to the previous version!|Version 4.0|1
Nice|Nice app|Version 4.0|4
Bring old version back|I'm still use iphone 3gs and can't upgrade to ios 7.0|Version 4.0|1
Fun with friends!!|If you have allot of friends, I do recommend getting this app. It fun to show them pictures, send them samples of the music your listening to, send them what movie your'e watching, and text them with stickers, voice audio, photos, or even videos!!! Fun for quick socialization. And add your friends, you won't have to worry about them creepy strangers tho. I love path. :D my BFBTPE's do too.|Version 4.0|5
Good|All is Good with the new upgrade ! But still need Fix the place check in , the old ver is better.|Version 4.0|4
Top lifinto|Superbe app!|Version 4.0|5
Keep it simple! new app is a mess|people use path coz its simple and its not facebook. now its turning into facebook.   this update is a mess|Version 4.0|1
Loved this app...until|New update. Lost all chats and the ability to chat. That was one of the main reasons i had this app. I loved that it was all in one place. This app on my iPad is useless now. And I have to have two apps on my no droid phone to do the same thing i used to do with one app. Very disappointed. Will likely not renew my subscription when it comes due.|Version 4.0|2
جميل|لكن يفضل وضع خاصيه بلوك وجعل الفيسات جميعها مجانية|Version 4.0|5
Bad!!!!|Its a bad version.. Cant text on path for ipad.. No apps for text! I try to find the text for path but only available for iphone, not for ipad! I hate this version, can i download the version before updated????????|Version 4.0|1
Love it|Path is so awesome!!!|Version 4.0|5
hate the new update|i’m a loyal user of path for a year and i hate the new update, the design is really ugly and catastrophe. i hate that now path for iPhone force me to visit my friend without my permission. and a separate messenger, that is really awful. go away abu rizal bakrie, don’t ruin our path with your money #hateARB|Version 4.0|1
Good app but its missing the point|I have had path before and i love the instant messages you can send to friend but now you have to download a seperate app inorder to send messages i find that pointless and makes the app path even more useless without the messaging option on the actually path app and not on the talk app i wont want 2 seperate apps and waste more space on my phone please put the instant messageing option on the original path app|Version 4.0|1
Why!?|Ok, I've been using path for three years and I must say this previous update is horrible! Here are a few reasons that I say this. One, you can not upload videos. Two, there no mic for the music section so now I have to manually put the song in, in which sometimes I don't know the name of the song. That feature helped me out a lot! Third, to my opinion it looks like a fake Facebook! I enjoyed using path because I like how different it's set up was! Fourth, I can't send messages directly from the app now I have to download a whole new app to send and receive messages!? That's bogus ! I'm really considering deactivating my account. I really dislike this update. You guys could have done way better!|Version 4.0|3
Unbelievable ugly interface|Can't believe the 4.0 update came from the same team.|Version 4.0|1
New bottom bar wastes screen|The latest update is not an improvement. That bottom bar is a ridiculous waste of valuable screen space. Here's hoping you come to your senses and remove it in the next update.|Version 4.0|2
A very bad update.|I wish you return the old version of Path. Its a very bad update, just don't try to be smart or try to take an advantage by providing features that aren't unwanted.|Version 4.0|1
HATE THE UPDATE|Just bring back the old message app to one app only, and I like the old look rather than the 'new' look. The old look looks more Path rather than this Facebook-ey feeling. Please use your own style|Version 4.0|1
what are u thinking?|bring back the old one...very pool design n UI..laggy...just bring back|Version 4.0|1
Stupid update|Please back to previous version|Version 4.0|1
Now, I'm so disappointed!!|This update is so bad, the designer is destroy a great app! Hope you will put your elegant design back!  Below is my old reviews, but that was for elegant app, not current one! ----------------------------  The most beautiful app when iOS 6 and still the most beautiful app on ios7!!! Path is my life journa! I love it!|Version 4.0|1
Urgent|The new update is really bad.|Version 4.0|1
Update|The worst update ever ,, please return the old one |Version 4.0|1
Disappionted|I do believe you guys've made a big mistake this time.|Version 4.0|2
New PATH IS ANNOYING|I PERSONALLY THINK THE NEW PATH IS NOT GOOD AT ALL... SEPARATING PATG CHAT WITH PATH TALK IS REALLY WASTING TIME AND PHONE MEMORY. It is not simple at all, it is annoying. I want the old path which the chat feature included in it..Thanks|Version 4.0|2
Update blows......... |I really USED to love Path..... Ugh.... Not only did they split the messaging app into a separate app for some UNGODLY RETARDED reason, but the NavBar on the bottom of the screen is a HUGE step backwards........ It USED to be so clean and refreshing, now it's like they're copying Facebook but only the crappy parts. Depressing.... |Version 4.0|2
Can't Log-In!!! |Whats wrong with this APP? i cant log-in with my previous account!!!!! FIX IT!!|Version 4.0|1
Amazing App|Great update to an amazing social network. However; Path Talk is not available as an iPad app so it seems silly that messaging was removed from the iPad app.  It would be even better if these features/things were added:  • TV Shows - we can say that we are watching movies, listening to music or reading a book. But there is no tv show option. Also, Shazam or Soundhound integration would be nice.  • Privacy Controls - Path is pretty awesome when it comes to privacy, but I can't alter whether past results are shown to close friends or all friends. Likewise, if I change somebody to a close friend it should give me the option to allow them to see previous close friend only posts.   • Better Sticker Organization - stickers never stay organized and it's hard to find stuff.   • More features for premium users - why are you charging us so so much and giving so little there haven't been new camera filters in forever and the sticker packs are rarely updated or added. Seems like you could give more for what we pay. Like an exclusive sticker pack, and the option to show how many steps we walked that day, or other exclusive info.  • More connectivity - the nike+ thing was okay when it worked, but that's about it.|Version 4.0|4
对更新后的path极度失望|UI变得更丑了，以前版本的UI更好看，也有更好的阅读体验，现在下面那么大一栏菜单，实在是太难看了！还有那个没用的path talk，你以为你分离出来用的人就多吗？不要学facebook…赶紧把UI改回去|Version 4.0|1
Bad update|Bad app update! My hundreds of moments and all friends are gone - there must be a better photo sharing app.|Version 4.0|1
Soon to be ex-premium Path user|I loved Path before this latest update. Emphasis on the past tense. I live overseas, due to a military posting, and Path was the perfect app for keeping in touch. I even paid the high price of becoming a Premium user. With the new update, though, I'll be letting me Premium account expire and seeking out a new way to chat with my friends and family back home. Two apps just to message people? Ridiculous. I don't want to waste space with multiple apps that used to be one. This is a horrendous update. If you can avoid updating, I suggest doing so. My iPad is updated, and utterly useless now, but I will not be updating my phone. Once my Premium account expires (very soon), I'll move on. It was nice while it lasted, Path.|Version 4.0|1
Too bad|The new update is awful !|Version 4.0|1
Baaad|Worst update i have seen ever ever |Version 4.0|1
WORST!!|this is the WORST update EVER!!  - connection issues when login - path talk is ridiculous  - the new design is horrible  please bring back the old Path.. we love Path the way it used to be!! and please please dont rise the friend limit.......|Version 4.0|1
Disappointed|I use Path everyday but this update is bad and disappointing ! I lost all my conversations and the interface was better before|Version 4.0|1
Bad update new path|New path???? So bad |Version 4.0|1
|The new update is nice but, when I log in the timeline loads slow, and I cant add more people but others can. Please fix it|Version 4.0|1
Worst update|What's wrong with dev nowdays ,they removed IM and then put in on another app and this crap update is horribly slow with worse ui also ,we want the old path back ,we love the simplicity in using it|Version 4.0|1
Path|Y'all need to do better|Version 4.0|1
CANNOT LOG IN|What happened?!|Version 4.0|1
Problem with new update|I love Path, but since the newest update I can no longer log in - what's going on? Any ways to fix this??|Version 4.0|3
Bad update..!!!!|Better 3.4.3 version than 4.0. Slow update timeline..!!!  Do not upgrade to this version, better wait the next update|Version 4.0|1
Terrible|The latest update is awful. The navigation lost it’s intuition. Settings is almost impossible to find. And whats up with messaging. Who talked Dave Morin into this one.|Version 4.0|1
Path is the best social app, hands down|These guys innovate in so many ways with both function and design. They actually care for your privacy. There are no ads. I will gladly support then with the premium access so long as they continue to protect my private data and keep up the awesome features and beautiful design.   Ignore the haters and 1-star reviews. These people want things to stay the same forever and are afraid of profess and innovation. The new update is great and the Talk app is nice. If you don't like it, then don't update! Turn off auto updates if you hate change so much! Losers.|Version 4.0|5
Don't update!!!|New update is horrible!!!  Do not update!  I hate it!|Version 4.0|1
Update is awful |the new bar at the bottom to resemble iOS is annoying large and takes the focus off of the moments and pictures!!! Bring back DM and why are you raising friend limits?!?!? it was good with the limit now it's going to be another myspace/Facebook page.|Version 4.0|1
Love Path, but hate new GUI|I've been using Path for several years now and it has easily become my go-to social media app. Even if I want to share things to Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr, I usually do it from Path. It helps me log moments like a journal and selectively share moments with the people who matter.   However, the newest update is pretty horrible. The new GUI takes up unnecessary screen real estate. The other GUI had a "+" for posting and kept everything else (notifications, friends, etc) out of the way unless needed. Now I'm forced to see a row of icons at the bottom regardless of whether I need them or not. And while I never cared much for the messaging feature, splitting it into its own separate app doesn't make much sense either. There's no reason to have download a second app, so now I'm even less incline to use it.   Path developers: restore the older GUI please. The new one is horrible!|Version 4.0|1
|I really like the new update it's AWESOME |Version 4.0|5
Absolute nightmare|Update 4.0 makes me cant log in and always connection prob whenever i tried to connect. Add much annoyance to me, i still can see notification from my friend commented at my Moment earlier. Its irked me most!! Worst possible update! Its like a gold become a mud overnight!! Dont ever update guys!!!|Version 4.0|1
Whats wrong!!|Why aren't there any chats anymore !!!!!  And why do i have to download a new App to chat with my friend on Path !  Please fix this Big Big issue please .|Version 4.0|1
Super|Is amazing app for me|Version 4.0|4
Good but not better|I got this app two days ago because I was sick of Facebook. And I really liked it and I still do. But I don't like that the dm feature is gone.|Version 4.0|3
4.0v|Horrible! And two apps?! I like the old version better|Version 4.0|1
Just hate it|So stupid wish i never updated |Version 4.0|1
Disappointed! |What have you done?!  you are making it harder to use! why making the DM in a different app?! i'm not gonna have two app for Path! besides after updating it,path kicked me out and I can no longer log in!!! what a mess   thanks your efforts though... but we want the OLD PATH! |Version 4.0|1
don't update|Worst update ever From top to bottom|Version 4.0|1
|The new update is laggy and has a lot of issues |Version 4.0|1
Why why!|The older version was better , path lost all what was charming about it!! Two applications , unlimited friends. Its turning into a facebook only in red !  Fix it !|Version 4.0|1
New update|The new interface looks nicer. But the app lags continuously. And the location service is totally blown off. I didn't like the idea of having another app for DMs also.|Version 4.0|2
Too bad|Very very bad update|Version 4.0|1
What a POS|Are you guys on crack or just F'ed up. The messaging thing is a joke. Why would I need a messaging app. I could use Facebook for messaging and I don't and won't. Wake up.|Version 4.0|1
Path|Bad path|Version 4.0|1
Disappointed|Every since path has updated it's been running slow && taking too long for things to load . Please fix it!|Version 4.0|3
Dont update the path this ugly unuseful update ever|The last updata so so so so so so so bad ، plz retend the old version|Version 4.0|1
The new update is so hard|Not good|Version 4.0|1
Worst update|U've uploded the worst update i've ever seen, was the best, to the worst |Version 4.0|1
Stubborn Poor Decisions|It is clear that the majority of Path users hate this new update. The app changed its unique and intelligent UI in favor of a more conventional boring one. Not only did those poor decisions affect the User interface, but has led for a negative change in functionality and convenience. The idea to have separate app for talk is clearly not in favor for the users, regardless of the justifications. The developers and decision makers of Path seem to be headed towards the direction of other social apps that people left in favor of Path, like Facebook.|Version 4.0|1
I want my older version of Path|Path on new version are become worst.. I cant see the clearer pict smoothly.. And we need to install another apps for sending message?? That so bad... Please do some revision for Path..|Version 4.0|1
Worst update|Worst update ever !!! Bring back the old path !! Stupid idea to separate it to two apps?:/|Version 4.0|1
Why the separate app?|Separating the app was a stupid idea.|Version 4.0|1
Bug|The new version has problems, can't verify my account, can't log in and now I can't even reset the password because there is error sending email !!!|Version 4.0|3
No landscaping in load photo|The updateis great, but still no switch to landscape mode when adding a pic. Please fix this.|Version 4.0|3
Why ?!|One of the enjoyable things in path was you are able to see your timeline and chat , now you can but with two separate apps! and honestly i don't like that and i don't think i will update|Version 4.0|2
Path version|Not everyone likes the new version I absolutely hate it one of the issues is that the chat is on another app what's the good thing ? And it's now becoming harder to use now my mother has issues using it and not many people want their battery showing it's not cool please next version return the chat in path not on talk and the bars please your reviewer , mgnm077|Version 4.0|1
Worst update ever!!!!!|I'll delete this garbage app till they fix it|Version 4.0|1
Get the old design back|4.0 is a step back. Huge line at the bottom with the controls tool big chunk of the content area. why? do you think I want to enjoy bottom bar most of the time or the actual content?   and top bar also stays the same height. see Instagram - make it smaller when you scroll|Version 4.0|1
Traditional Chinese translation is WRONG!|When you set Traditional Chinese, you get Simplified Chinese. These are different languages use by people in different country!|Version 4.0|1
Booo|Worst update ever!! Chat is in a different app and path still has refresh bug, it freezes and sometimes kicks me out, won't load people's timeline when I visit their path, can't see friends of my friends.

Disappointed.|Disappointed with the removal of Talk. I'm supposed to download another chat app??|Version 4.0|2
17th request.|Update 20 June: With the recent update I can no longer log in. Path has become a much bigger frustration than it's worth. Sad, because it used to be such a great app.  Previously: Literally 17 requests to add friends in the year 2014. I keep this review up to date. Please make it stop. PLEASE STOP.  Update: I've practically stopped using Path because of this annoyance. So I probably won't continue to keep a tally, until eventually I decide to delete the app altogether. Goodbye Path.|Version 4.0|1
Disappointed !!!|Nowdays the only app I use for communication is Path. I know that the new update fixes a lot of problems and bugs, thank you for your effort, but I'm very disappointed from removing the messing to another app don't destroy Path for things you don't need. Please bring the messaging to the native app and don't do what Facebook did.  I hope that you will respond as soon as you can.|Version 4.0|3
