Video problems|I don't really understand why they haven't updated their video quality.

The video professionals are all hoping, waiting and praying.|Version 6.10.1|3

Following|Instagram is wonderful .. This app jus needs to make sure when they update the your followers they need to also update the number of people the account is following for example..

Instagram is great!!|I have had Instagram for a long time and it has really affected me. If you were going to ask 10 kids over the age of 9 but under the age of 13 if they had Instagram or Facebook about 7 of them would say I have Instagram and about 1 or 2 would say Facebook or say that they don't have any social network. For adults Facebook may be more interesting but for kids in the 21st century Instagram is their social network.|Version 6.10.1|5

Instagram Wat R U Doing ¿|Instagram was great and all until it persistently crashed every time I attempted to go on the app... is this because I have an iOS 6 iPod 4?  you guys have to understand that not everyone is fortunate enough to update to the iOS 7 or buy the iPhone 6 or 7. so please, fix this problem because this is my favorite social media out of all the social medias I have, and it would be a shame to not be able to use it all.|Version 6.5.1|2

Good app, some thoughts|This app is excellent: easy to use and loads pretty fast. You don't have to sign in each time either, which is nice. I wish there was a way to easily get to the beginning of someone's feed, so that when you start following a new person, you can start from day 1. I also would love a way to keep the hashtags saved even after I close the app or sign out of my account. But overall, an excellent app for the price (aka free).|Version 6.10.1|4

Love it!|Pictures are the only thing I liked from Facebook posts, so Instagram is my favorite app ever..|Version 6.10.1|5
I love this app but...|I wish I could block my profile from everyone and not just from individuals. If I have a few busy weeks ahead of me, and I don't want to log on just to like friends' photos, to reply back to comments, or to followback someone, I'd like to have this option. The only other choice we're given besides blocking users individually, is to delete our entire profile, which then permanently deletes all of our history and I'd hate to lose every post, my username and everything in between just because I need to take a little break. Also, if I block my followers individually, they'll know because we will no longer be followers, and I don't want to offend anyone over needing time. Please please pleas add the "blocking your profile from everyone" feature! It would be of great help to many of us instagram users!|Version 6.10.1|4

Instagram|Ok I love this app. I think it's a great social media app. But I only have one problem, I would greatly appreciate if you made it easier to switch through multiple accounts. As of today you have to log out and sign into the other account. And if you want to go back you have to sign out again and re log in. Maybe make it so you can quickly toggle through multiple accounts. Everything else is great!|Version 6.10.1|5

This one glitch though|The app itself is pretty good, but this one glitch I can't get by.  Everytime I go to request to follow someone, it won't work. The app used to let me follow ANYBODY. Instagram makers, it really needs to be fixed. I have many friends at school who are getting upset that I won't follow them back.  It just keeps bugging out and just won't let me follow anyone.

I like it but it needs improvements|It is a great app but it needs some improvements. One you should require accounts that have like 500k followers to be public. Two say in someone's bio where they live (optional) and stuff like that.|Version 6.10.1|4
NEED HELP!!!!!!! NOT WORKING|Ok so the other day I deleted the Instagram app out of my phone then about 40 minutes to an hour later tried re downloading, it won't download. Even tried shutting my device and turning it back on. And I have lots of space in my phone. It looks like it's downloading but It really ain't. It's been like this for 4 days now if I can get some help on this that would be just peachy. Thanks|Version 6.10.1|4

Okay but...|Ever since I made a new account a few weeks ago, it says that I need to verify my email address, but every time it says it can't and it keeps asking my for my phone number even though I have an iPod. I reported to them about this situation like 4 times and nothing has happened. Now I can't do a single thing. The app itself is good but the email thing has made this app useless.|Version 6.10.1|3
Instagram|I like Instagram because I like motivational quotes, pictures of food and cats.|Version 6.10.1|5

Simple photo editing|This is a fun tool for minor photo editing. Quick and easy to use.|Version 6.10.1|5

Can't live without this app|Anytime I see something or feel something I post on Instagram. It's the perfect platform for photographers and people that want to express on photo how they feel. One of the best applications out today. Couldn't live and praise God without it.|Version 6.10.1|5

Good app|Generally a good app. WOULD recommend to a friend. |Version 6.10.1|4
AN IDEA HERE!!|Ok so IG is so good but I have many instagram accounts, my personal, one for my fotography and others so I would like IG to use the Tumblr "switch" to change the account without having to log out because is so annoying. I should post 1 pic every day and I don't do it because I hate to log out from my personal account BUT if IG had this possibility I would love it even more than I do now. PLEASE DO IT|Version 6.10.0|3

I'm crying|Someone help I LOVE Instagram but I have an iPod 4 so I cant get iOS 7 and at first it wasn't a problem with Instagram but now it won't work so I deleted it but when I tried to re download it, it said I needed iOS 7 or later and to update BUT I CAN'T UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Somebody please help me |Version 6.10.1|3

Really IOS7 only?|I've instagram for a few years now and my accounts are finally picking up. Now you put the ios7 again? It's not fair that all the iPod 4 people now have to beg family for another electronic just because you have decided to up the update requirement. Not all people can afford a new system and this is very unconventional. Could u just switch it to the last iPod 4 update so that all can use it?!|Version 6.10.1|1
AWSOME app|You can write or post anything you desire and also you can get a lot of followers|Version 6.10.1|5

Awesome|It's the best, I love it and it's always updated|Version 6.10.0|5
Awesome|Look at me/ you get to see for free/ what cost years/ no tears|Version 6.10.1|5
It can be improved.|There are a lot of great improvements to Instagram. However there are some things that can be done to improve the fluidity and modern look to it. - Servers are not an issue when it comes to videos which seem to have constant problems with freezing and losing sound.  - Also, I think accounts should get cover photos like seen on Twitter and the follower information and profile editing tab should be changed to something newer looking and not look almost the exact same as it did when the update on iOS 7.0 came out.  Other than that, it's my favorite social media app/website! Keep up the good work.|Version 6.10.1|4
An Awsome App|Easy to use and fun to contact your friends and family|Version 6.10.1|5
My opinion|Besides it not being filtered, and nudity, i say it's a good way of connecting through pictures with friends.|Version 6.10.1|3
Wow|I think it's messed up that you can't get the app if you don't  have iOS 7.0 because iPod 4 or iPhone 4 can't get the app and I had Instagram for a while now I can't get app because of this stupid stuff and I'm not going buy new iPod just to get Instagram should do something to change this would be very happy|Version 6.10.1|2
Instagram is by far the best out there|Instagram is probably my favorite social media app that I have. Instagram is fun to go on when you want inspiration for your pics or you're just bored or you just want something to do. It's a fun app to connect with your friends, and comment on their photos it shows that the Instagram team worked very hard on the app because you can go on the explorer page and just take things from there and post them yourself that's what I do often and that is the room longer view but it's worth it. Anyways I'm not done yet I also wanted to say that I've had the Instagram app for about five years and you only had a problem with it once I had to restart it because it wasn't working and I want to give me a honest review telling you that it's not perfect but it does work I have the iPhone 6 and it works fine but the update and stuff and lunch I have a Samsung room for the have this phone and it still works fine so i'm just saying in a work on an inversion I'm not promising that it'll will work but I'm just saying that it just might you if you have problems though get rid of it quickly you can block people if you don't want to follow them all them you can put your account on private so your parents can go on there and check out what you're doing you can block any when you want personally I don't like my parents I'm 15 years old and they just want to post my posting new journey thing so I don't see the problem with my parents going on my Instagram or Facebook I let them go on their on my phone what is the meaning is really mattered to me so I don't anonymous ranting about how I should check out the Twitter at the Facebook app Tombler Pinterest and I think that's it I know some is a misspelling I'm doing the voice talk type thing on the iPhone is only on the 5C in the six since it's less but I don't wanted to say I hope that you get the Instagram app because it's very good and I know you know why like it okay bye have a good time when the Instagram app Siri add.|Version 6.10.1|5
Bug|Please fix!! It says I've been  disabled and I haven't done anything but yet I can log in in the website but I can't use the mobile app. This is a great app but this is getting annoying|Version 6.10.1|4
Love it|It's amazing app I use it to connect with my friends ❤️❤️❤️❤️|Version 6.10.1|5
Instagram positive review|Probably use this more than fb or Twitter or snapchat. I use it for sharing, searching ideas and companies, and making friends and connections.  Only downside is the squared and sized down photos if u don't take the pic with Instagram to begin with.|Version 6.10.1|4
Social media done right|People can go ahead and facebook, and all that but I prefer Instagram. It is a really fun app and a great way to share things with your friends/family.  I dig it!|Version 6.10.1|5
App not working|After the app downloads and installs it disappears and will not open|Version 6.10.1|1
I LOVE IT!!!|I love Instagram because I can keep up with my friends and post stuff from all my trips!!! I also love the dm so me and all my friends can have convos when we're not at school!

Goodly|I love it it's the best ever everyone should have Instagram|Version 6.10.1|5
I ❤ IG but...  (read below )|The problem is that I cannot do ANYTHING !!!!! I can't like, comment, post, delete pics, update my profile !! none of that!!! Cause of that stupid confirmation that its me well of course it is me DUHH  I mean like hacked or not you can still put in your phone number and confirm it  to add on to that I don't even have a phone number I have an IPod 4 with an email not an IPod 4 with a phone number and then I have a texting app that gives me a phone number but it won't send me the confirmation I enter it in right never get the text !!!  at least add something so I can chooses to put in a email or phone number or I can't use Instagram !!!!!! FIX IT PLEASE !!!!!|Version 6.5.1|1
|I am soooo mad. >:( Instagram only works for ios7 now. It kept on logging me out so I deleted and redownloaded  And instead of saying to use the latest ios6 version it wouldnt let me download saying u need ios7 or later. Supposably when you download something you can redownload with the latest version, and now you can't.  I love this app and this this is the worst news ever... >:( This is soo unfair.|Version 6.10.1|1

Cool|I like it a lot. It's fun and simple. The only thing is that why can't you delete the account if you want? And the videos now—how can you pause them because I really don't know. Anyways, beside those tiny things, the app is great and I use it to talk to my friends throgh DM and post some stuff. It's cool. If you are reading this, get it. |Version 6.10.1|4
Good|It is a good app|Version 6.10.1|4

Easy to use|App is really easy to use and I love it. The only reason I am giving it four is any time there is an update something ends up being taken away, like being able to crop a video, after an update I was no longer able to cut and crop I hope this glitch gets fixed soon. I love that you have to tap in order to hear a video|Version 6.10.1|5
new update|THE NEW UPDATE ONLY SHOWS SOME OF YOUR PHOTOS SO YOU CANT POST MOST OF THEM PLEASE FIX|Version 6.10.1|1

I  this app but.....|I'm not sure if it's the downloading problem or if it's Instagrams. When the new update just came it wouldn't download so now I can go on my Instagram|Version 6.10.1|5
Instagram for iPod gen 4|Well I love instagram but it's been getting slow so ,as I always have done, I delete instagram and then reinstall it. But now it's saying I need iOS 7.0 (something like that) and I have the one before iOS 7.0 and it won't let me install it again. I also (having the iPod gen 4) cannot update. So if I could atleast download the old version that would be great. So if u have an iPod 4 and instagram is acting slow then don't delete, just have a friend send u a DM and then u can go on from there. Idk if its just my iPod but whatever. I'm just mad cause I love instagram and my phone is super glitchy and can't see emojis or cool fonts. So basically i couldn't see my own bio! Please consider making instagram available to all iOS updates, or maybe it's apples problem idk but I figured everyone should know so then they don't delete it like I did. Apple should have it so all apple product users can download anything they want. Ive been having issues with instagram for awhile now though so...... If anyone knows how to fix this problem just reply in one of your reviews. Thanks. Sorry for this being so long.|Version 6.10.1|3

Uploading pictures.|I edited this picture so I could upload it to my account, but do you know what happens? It crashes! I don't post often, maybe one every two weeks, but it normally works. I've deleted the app and redownloaded it, restarted my iPod, closed the app all the way and nothing. Fix this.|Version 6.10.1|3

Switching Btwn Multiple Accounts|I love Instagram. Who doesn't? It is by far my favorite social media platform. I believe a lot of us have two or more different Instagram accounts, whether it be for business and personal, blogging and personal, or for two separate interests. Can we please have a way to easily switch between accounts, as opposed to logging out and logging back in each time?|Version 6.10.1|5
Crashed|Ok with the new update about new editing tools my app crashes every time I open it. I hope you fix this bug quickly.|Version 6.10.1|1

Hmmmm|The phone app is is rather limited as far as viewing goes I see very little of what other people post, unless I go on my PC then I see so much more. I like the app but it needs to work better with my iPhone. Having the option to have the full picture and maybe having better cropping options would also be a plus.|Version 6.10.1|3

Instagram|Instagram is awesome it is also how I met my girlfriend who I am in love with☺️|Version 6.10.1|5
Suggestion??|I really love every aspect of instagram, except when I want to delete pictures in bulk.  Could your next update include a way to delete several of your pictures at once please (kind of like how you can delete multiple pictures off your camera roll at once)? I think it would make things easier.  Thanks :)|Version 6.10.1|5
Amazing|I like it|Version 6.10.1|5

Instagram on ipod 4|i have a ipod 4 touch so it dosent let it download since i need iOS 7 and i really like this app|Version 6.10.1|2
ʙʀᴜʜʜʜʜʜʜʜʜʜ|I logged out of my account because I forgot my password.  I read something that said that Instagram would send me an email with my new password.  I have clicked on send me an email 1,000,000 times and my email has not shown up.  I want to get back into my account but I can't.  Fix the problem because if people lose their password and log out, they won't get the email.  Then they will delete the app.  Also, I went to the Instagram Help Center and it did not help me at all.|Version 6.8.0|3
Instagram|Okay so first of all,I do love Instagram but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that,well lately every once in awhile I click the app and then, BOOM it backs out and keeps on doing that!! Ugh so frustrating! Idk it just gets me mad at the app fr -___- And the only way it lets me back in is that I have to update it, I have updated it 4 times last week-_-fr? And the thing is it's the same update it's not a higher update or anything it's the same one!! And the other reason is that the videos,it always doesn't let me watch em keeps on making me refresh the vid. Well sometimes it lets me but kinda glitches.-_-but other wise I love the app. Sharing videos and pics and stuff|Version 6.5.1|3
Now requires iOS 7 only |I've been having trouble with Instagram and when I would delete it and it would let me use the latest version before iOS 7 but now since I only have a iPod 4 I can't get iOS 7 , when i deleted it , it wont let me get it back bc if that and now I can NEVER get Instagram AGAIN  why?! Please please please! Change that |Version 6.10.1|1
Bruhh|I love Instagram|Version 6.10.1|5
Yaaaaasssss|This social media is almost the only app I really love because you can comment on other pictures, like the pictures, and follow people you know or want. I especially love how you can use Facebook to log on or off , and use it to find followers but the only problem is, when you do your videos ,you only have 15 seconds to make one. So that's not  good for Instagram . Also, I don't understand why you have to tap for sound . It should already by sound coming out . But other than those few things I love this app❤️|Version 6.10.1|5
I|I still only have an IOS 6 I pod 4 and apple hasn't updated the I pod 4 so all I'm saying I think that they should not have it up grade to IOS 7 yet. I had it than it crashed on me so I deleted it like the many times I have had before when it does that and I tried to get it again and I can't because apple hasn't updated the I pod 4 to now I am kinda mad. It was the most wonderful app but now I can't have it.|Version 6.10.1|5

What is the deal with this!?! Help me please!!|Version 6.10.1|1
amazing a couple upgrades needed|I LOVE this app and I use it 25/8 but a couple annoying things...  1) I wish you could see when someone unfollows you because most people want to unfollow the people that unfollow them and it doesn't show in your feed. I have to have a whole another app for that  2) I wish instead of having to get another app you can be able to "instasize" it on Instagram instead of buying another app  3) Whenever someone tags me in a photo and I look at the picture on my acc then leave, the orange thing keeps popping up saying I have haven't seen it|Version 6.10.1|5

Glitches|Sometimes the app glitches but over all I'm happy with the app|Version 6.10.1|4
Downloading The App...|Hello! I'm Sierra. So, my problem is when I want to download the app, it doesn't download. I keep clicking on the download app button and it says 'you must have iOS 7 version' in order to download this app. But it never said that until yesterday. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.|Version 6.10.1|1
Its cool|FC BAYERN 5-0 FC PORTO|Version 6.10.1|5
Latest update|The app is great! And I use it every day. But with the latest update, when I open the app it crashes instantly. I hope you will fix this very soon.|Version 6.10.1|1
Great overall|Not use to writing reviews. Lul My first ever but yeah Instgram is great. Pics people post are awesome. You can screenshot stuff but that's a iPhone feature Lul uh yeah get the app.|Version 6.10.1|4
Problems!|I loved IG & was using it several times a day, but lately it just randomly shuts off on me, or it says "Can't refresh feed."  Also, when I try to add a new hashtag as a comment, it shows the time as though it went through, but when I check the hashtag, my photo is not posted there!!!  This is all very annoying.  I tried several times to submit a bug report, and that would not go through either.|Version 6.10.1|1
Great app! Not so great users...|I'm loving Instagram! I use it for my business and am thinking about making a second account for non business purposes. I have to say, the users aren't as great. My "discover" feed is frequently flooded with pictures of naked women and sometimes pornographic photos and videos. I've reported these accounts and images for a violating of ToS but it doesn't seem to do much of anything. Also, you can't delete people's comments on your photos. Do I need to explain how that can be bad? Blocking the user doesn't remove the comment. So it's good and it could be better if only the people using it were good.|Version 6.10.1|3
AWESOME|I used to not be able to comment or follow people but now I can and is AWESOME!|Version 6.10.1|5
Love it|It's a nice app～|Version 6.10.1|5

Loosing followers|I've been checking Instagram for the past couple of days and I've been losing followers automatically out of no where . I check to see who unfollowed me but it shows no one did .. I had 704 went to 703 went all the way down to 700 yesterday I had 700 no today I have 699  how is this happening?? Fix please|Version 6.10.1|1
Love It!!|I really like the new feature where we can add color to our photos. I personally like it better than the filters. One suggestion to make Instagram better is to see the profile picture up close. Like when you tap on it, it'll go to full screen. I think that make Instagram a whole lot better!|Version 6.10.1|5
I love Instagram|I love Instagram. I would love more filter options though |Version 6.10.1|5
Great|Awesome app!|Version 6.10.1|5
Love it!|I enjoy being able to mute the sound when scrolling thru the feed .. Just wish once u go to someone's page and click on a pic u could just scroll/swipe thru the pics instead of having to go to each one individually! Maybe make the videos longer? Other than that, app is great!!|Version 6.10.0|4

Love this app!!! ❤️|This is my most favorite & used app by far...A great way to share photos with friends and the world if download it u won't be disappointed at all I use this app everyday! And it's a great way to promote ur business or as an online portfolio.|Version 6.10.1|5
Fun stuff|As a newer Instagram member I have to say that it is so fun to play with. I love the filters. I only wish there was a way to adjust the sizing of the photos without losing the quality of the image. But perhaps there is and I just haven't found it yet. It is pretty user friendly and easy to use|Version 6.10.1|4
I love Instagram!!|If you love taking pictures and sharing with friends and family, you NEED this app! ☺️|Version 6.10.1|5
Digital artist|Instagram is so great for what my take on photography. I love it!!!|Version 6.10.1|5

Eye opening|Love this app because it forces me to open my eyes to the beauty around me plus I've met a great crew of peeps on here!|Version 6.10.1|5
Clean pictures.|I think Instagram is a great way to share beautiful moments with your friends. However, bad videos, bad pictures are everywhere on IG now and it's really irritating. Kids can download the app and see all those on IG. Whoever wants to show off their bodies should be on another side, not this. If you can fix it, IG will be an awesome, meaningful and clean. Thankz|Version 6.10.1|3
Awesome|Perfect interaction with the world!|Version 6.10.1|4
Love Instagram!||Version 6.9.2|5
Good, but new problems|Some photos are not showing, and refuse to load, even after I redownloaded the app|Version 6.10.1|2
Multiple accounts|This app would be way better if you could save multiple accounts to the app kinda like Twitter does, it would help a lot to bypass resigning in over and over again. I would appreciate it|Version 6.10.1|4
Video freezes|I love Instagram and be on this app daily , but the videos that I'm either tagged in or run across occasionally freezes! I've tried refreshing the page, foreclosing the app, and I've even uninstalled and re-installed it !  I love watching my favorite celebrities videos but this has gotten ridiculous! I can care less about all the features of a filter because there are other apps but PLEASE fix this problem or Instagram would be another washed up app!|Version 6.9.2|4

It's okay|It could have more features but it's fun to share picture with your friends|Version 6.10.1|4

My feed won't load! And I still have no sound!|I seriously loved this app but now every time I get on maybe one or two pictures on my feed will load the rest won't. And suddenly the sound went out on all the videos. =.= it's seriously making me angry. I'm ready to just delete the stupid app cause what's the point in having an app that doesn't work properly?|Version 6.10.1|1
Videos freezes.|Im not sure if it's me or ig, but every time I wanna watch the videos it freezes and the sound be in the background is on making me miss the video. Even after I wait for it to start again it still freezes. Please fix.|Version 6.10.1|3

15 seconds to 30 seconds|This update is still garbage the tap for sound is still there and you could atleast make the video limit 20 seconds or 30 seconds. Is that so hard? I'm hoping for a better update in the future|Version 6.10.0|1
Developers need to pay attention|Always issues loading photos and uploading. This version is horrible. Developers are getting lazy like all others do. Frustrating and disappointing.|Version 6.10.1|1

Like IG a lot...|Use the app daily for business and personal.  It would be nice if you were able to view the account profile photo of users. The vids can sometimes be buggy but I suppose that's my carrier and not the app? Look forward to much more Instagram lovin'.|Version 6.10.1|4
Love it|It's my only social media app and I love it.|Version 6.10.1|5
I HATE THE NEW RULES.|the new rules about the hash tags are dumb. why do I have to add hash tags to the caption of the photo when I post it? it looks ugly to me when I have tons of hash tags on my photos. I post them on my photos and delete them later. Instagram is all about hash tags and the fact they're pretty much useless makes Instagram so lame. please make it go back to the way it used to be..I would give this game 5 stars if so.|Version 6.10.1|2
It's ight|Insta is cool and all but there should be something where your ghost followers either like your stuff or don't follow you,I'm tired of ghosties and I ain't about to go one by one blocking people cause some I actually wanna see their page too but yeah and it shouldn't have to work under cellular data cause it wastes all my data and I'm on it so much I run it down but yeah I give it a 4 cause of hacks also,people work super hard for followers and someone just hacks their 35k or sum,like really?wow that's so unfair and I don't even understand how People ever hack but I know if mine gets hacked Imma be mad|Version 6.10.1|4

NeetcuhzenBruh|It's Noice|Version 6.10.1|5

Love this app!!|Instagram is the height of the online social world! It's the perfect way to stay connected and express yourself through your pictures. I only wish that when different accounts "like" your pictures, despite the number of "likes", it would DISPLAY the number rather than a collection of names. I usually have about five people "liking" my pictures, and the jumble of account names is rather an eyesore. But that is a small flaw in the perfection that is Instagram! I recommend it to anyone and everyone.|Version 6.10.1|5
Crashing|For some reason EVERYTIME I try to upload a photo is crashes. If I didn't add filters or anything it would be fine, but the filters are causing the app to crash.|Version 6.10.1|3
It's ok but...|I have had Instagram since it came out and I absolutely love it. There is one thing though, now when I opened up the app it always glitches and takes a long time for it to load then, it says that the feed is not refreshed. So it takes about two or three minutes for me to actually get on the app which is a long time considering how fast I can open other social media apps. I'm not bashing the app but it is a little annoying. I love this app nonetheless and I will continue to use it.|Version 6.10.1|4
