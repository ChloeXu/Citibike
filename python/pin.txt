Pinterest|I am generally obsessed with this app. Every now & then I encounter a glitch or two, but nothing severe. I love it.|Version 4.5.1|5
Room for improvement|I don't like that it restarts my search if I'm not logged in. That really annoys me I feel like the site should pick up where I was rather than make me search again |Version 4.5.1|3

UPDATE- I love Pinterest but on my iPhone....|If I get an email notification there has been a pin added to a board & I click the link in the email - it still takes me to the home page or asks me to log in. I never logged out! PLEASE FIX This! I love Pinterest but when I get an email from them on my phone & I click on one of the boards through the email, it won't take me to that board - it pops up quick then it takes me to the home page of Pinterest. Very annoying - please fix & I will give 5 stars|Version 4.5.1|3

Log on|I have loved this app up till last week. For some unknown reason I can not log into the app on my phone. I use my Facebook account for log in so I'm not sure if this is a Pinterest issue or Facebook. I can log in on on my computer and my iPad but not my iPhone. I've even tried deleting both apps and reinstalling. Nothing helps!!  I'm having withdrawals from not being able to get into Pinterest during the day.|Version 4.5.1|4

Pinterest|I follow many people here. Their ideas are priceless.|Version 4.5.1|5
Loving...|It!|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome app but just a suggestion|Wondering if we could have the option of undoing a pin? Sometimes I'll accidentally pin something to the wrong board and it's a hassle to go all the way in and edit the settings of the pin just to move it. With an "Undo Pin" option, if we accidentally pin it to the wrong board, we can quickly fix it.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|Updates all the time great because it always available|Version 4.5.1|5
Used to love it|I used to love Pinterest, but I'm frustrated by the new "picked for you" and "promoted by" pins. This used to be a place where I could find + keep track of my interests, but now I feel bombarded by advertisements and distractions. They sold out. Very unhappy.|Version 4.5.1|2
Cool app, pics are high quality|The all is great the only thing I don't like is that you can't zoom the pics.|Version 4.5.1|4
Awesome|Love it|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|Looks like a nice app. Lots of cool ideas. To bad I can't figure out how to use it! To bad some wood projects don't have plans to go with them!|Version 4.5.1|2

Great app|Luv it|Version 4.5.1|5
Update: MUCH better!|4/8: it's crashing every 5 minutes!  Revert back 2 updates to when it actually worked!!! The quick choices for pinning, messaging, and editing are gone! You have to go into each pin to do it. Grrrr. It still doesn't tell you if you've pinned with the new "suggested" quick buttons! 4/22: the old quick buttons are back!!!  Thank you!  Now I can pin, like, and edit quickly! Unfortunately it still crashes quite often. But hey, it's a free freaking app and I love it!  So those complaining about the "picked for you" pins need to shush, how else can this awesome site remain free!!!!|Version 4.5.1|4
My fave|Pinterest has something for everyone my favorite app|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome! Love it!|A lot of people are rating Pinterest on here. First let me talk about the app. The app is good. It's convenient and just as functional as the full desktop site. Then the actual Pinterest. It's great and i love it!! It's a great way to get inspired to do things and it has great instructional posts to help you diy (do it yourself) and feel accomplished. All of the recipes are great and give me new ideas for recipes to make and save for another time. I would recommend that you get it and make an account although i done know what you intend to use it for (recipes, home improvement, inspiration, etc). Have fun with it like i have!|Version 4.5.1|5
My Pinterest was hacked.|I was notified via my personal email that two items were re pinned ...I had been shopping online for special occasion dresses. A  shady company spotted that trend and created a board on my account with two mystery dresses with links for sale. The company seemed to be selling knock off products. Privacy is now a greater concern for me on Pinterest. I hope the situation gets fixed soon|Version 4.5.1|2
Awesome|An endless array of things to look at and learn! I can get lost for hours on this site!|Version 4.5.1|5

Very nice|Very good!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|I love Pinterest!!! By far my favorite app!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Good, but Room for Improvement|I love the concept of Pinterest. However, I echo the suggestions in other reviews. First, the auto refresh when looking at another pin is ANNOYING!! Please correct. Also, please add the ability to rearrange boards & rearrange pins within boards. I primarily access Pinterest with my iPad, it is bigger than my phone & more portable than my laptop.|Version 4.5.1|3
Pinterest|This app is dope|Version 4.5.1|5

GREAT APP!|Pinterest is a great app! I use it so often and get so many ideas from it. I just have ONE little critique. I really wish that you could change a public board to a secret board! I'm trying to change my account a little, but I also want to keep my old stuff. that was the only thing I really wanted! overall Pinterest is probably the best app I have. I love it SOOOOO much! if you could just do that one little thing...it would be so awesome!|Version 4.5.1|5

Great creative app|I love it I can can find so many things to look up and find so many cool ideas|Version 4.5.1|5
I love pintrest|I love it a lot|Version 4.5.1|5
Great!|I've been a member since it was invite only and have really likes it since. The one thing I would change would be to be able to get a variety of pins. It seems like all the suggested pins I see on my home feed are related to one of my boards-the one with the most pins. I get that its my main interest but I could use variety on my feed.|Version 4.5.1|4
Problems with New Update|I love Pinterest, but the new update is making the app randomly crash on me!|Version 4.5.1|2

Okay|I'm not a Pinterest junkie, so I find the app just adequate. Annoys me though when it alerts me to something - a new pin or a message - and there's nothing actually there.|Version 4.5.1|3
Minor Improvement suggestion|Everything about the app is great but why can't I change an already made board into being secret? That seems like an easy feature to make possible.|Version 4.5.1|4
Addicting!|Best App ever! So addicting....but I learn so much.|Version 4.5.1|5

Great reference|Other than guys making fun of me using this "girl app", it's a great resource...|Version 4.5.1|5
Robert Biter MD Babies by the Sea|What a great resource to inspire anyone to live life better, design, build, create and inspire one's self and the world!|Version 4.5.1|5
One Major Issue|Signed up to use the app so my fiancée and I could share pics with each other for our upcoming wedding. But she can't seem to send me a message with the link to her board after she added me as a user. It shows my name but I didn't get an auto-message and didn't get the email she sent. Why wouldn't it just pop up automatically when I log in? And why can't she just message it to me right in the app? Weird issue that's very frustrating.|Version 4.5.1|3
Pinterest|I've been using this app for a while now and I absolutely love it! I use it all the time for recipes for ideas to do with my daughter. It's fast, never had any problems with it and highly recommend it !!!|Version 4.5.1|4
Great|One of my favorite apps! Perfect when looking for something, perfect when having a few minutes to spare. My family thinks I'm an amazing cook, and all I do is look up recipes from Pinterst. |Version 4.5.1|5
Love|Awesome|Version 4.5.1|5
Great App!|Fun and full of great stuff. I go to Pinterest as much as I google!! Real talk!|Version 4.5.1|5
I love the app but…|Pinterest is an awesome app that I've gained quite an appreciation for as of late however the auto-refresh drives me up a wall because I'll often lose my place because of it. And the biggest issue of all is that it will often crash. What's most upsetting about that is when I'm about to pin something that I really like & it crashes & as a result, I can't find the pin. That's very frustrating. Other than that, I love the app. Please fix whatever bugs you may have & the auto refresh is a nice idea but not when you leave the app for a split second to retrieve a call or whatever & return & have to start all over sometimes to no avail.|Version 4.5.1|4
.|Love!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it!|I find myself unable at times to close the iPad and go to bed. Great ideas for all things|Version 4.5.1|5
Fun but sometimes frustrating...|I love Pinterest for keeping track of ideas and sites for just about anything. There are so many great ideas out there. My frustration comes from the auto refresh. If I need to leave the app even for a few seconds, it goes back to the home screen and refreshes my feed. This is SO frustrating when you've scrolled way down, clicked a link and fallen into a rabbit hole finding something really cool, then get interrupted before having a chance to pin. I have given up on re-finding so many neat ideas because of this. PLEASE make auto refresh optional or put a time limit like refreshing if it's been left for an hour so that it doesn't do this after literally seconds. I'm with those who say it's way easy to refresh your self by touching the top to go to the top of your feed and just pull it down. Please fix so this can be a perfect app!   I also miss being able to enter a comment when pinning from Safari but that's not too bad. It also crashes but that may be my phone. I have an iPhone 4S.|Version 4.5.1|4
Cool|This app makes me waste more time than any other app I have! Lol but it's awesome and addictive and flexes your creative mind to accomplish something. :)|Version 4.5.1|4
Pinterest|I just love this site.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love this app|I have a lot of great ideas|Version 4.5.1|4
pinterest update|First you email suggested boards, when I click on one, it immediately says I have to open in the  Pinterest app. When I do this I don't get the board that I'm interested in. I get your general suggestions instead.|Version 4.5.1|3
Imprescindible|Love these app|Version 4.5.1|5
Now pop up adds|Can't even get through 5 pins without an ad, really? Most of them repeat. You could at least offer a paid version where there are no ads!|Version 4.5.1|1
Lovely|Life changing app|Version 4.5.1|5
LOVE|This is the best picture site and idea site ever! What an inspiration! You can save the pictures for your wallpapers on your iPhone and iPad, get recipes, ideas for decorating, fashion ideas, links to places to buy things! The list goes on! It's the best!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Very good app|Works well|Version 4.5.1|5
Very useful!|I just started using the app if you weeks ago and I love it. I haven't quite figured out all of the ins and outs, hopefully soon. This is a great way to explore so many topics. I am currently using it to explore fashion, cooking, and places to travel and hike.|Version 4.5.1|4
I CAN FIND EVERYTHING!!|I love the app because I can   Find anything I want, from diy's to inspirational quotes, to how to make a healthy garden. easy to use, but sometimes if I press that button that refreshes to other thingys, I lose my place, and I have to search the thingy I wanted again. I wish I could rate it a 4.5, because it's a pretty awesome app!|Version 4.5.1|4
Annoying!!!!|Love Pinterest but now it's not working. The board will not refresh for a week now to show me any new pens!|Version 4.5.1|1
Pinterest is the greatest|Pinterest is a find anything place no matter what it is. It is a time consumer because you get caught up in looking at all the pins, ideas, recipes etc.... It is the greatest|Version 4.5.1|5

My favorite App!!!|Can't live without my Pinterest!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Addicted|I love this app, it is so additive that it drives my family crazy. No matter where I'm at(except driving) I'm on it. Good job creator of Pinterest. What would I do without you|Version 4.5.1|5
Great place for ideas|I use it to find tutorials and get ideas for the crafts I make. I like it because instead of going to multiple sites and searching, I can see at a glance what is available and click on it.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love pininterest|Love this app except when it crashes and closes down|Version 4.5.1|4
Pinterest|Very fun|Version 4.5.1|5
Sick of the promoted ads!|I generally love this app, but I rarely see anything in my feed from the people I follow.  Instead, my feed is constantly inundated with ads and Pinterest "picks for you," which are never even close to similar pins I've pinned in the past.  I'm honestly quite sick of the ads.  I have over 17 THOUSAND pins, and I'm starting to wonder if I should delete my Pinterest.  It's not MY own anymore;  it's solely for the advertisers.|Version 4.5.1|3
Finding style|This gave me ideas for furniture and home decorating while giving me a new style in clothing. This is great for looking a things that interest you and help you get inspired. 10/10 social network.|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome! Minor issues, but awesome!|First of all, I am a Pinterest addict. Second of all, the glitchy Pinterest app on my Kindle just wasn't cutting it. When I found this, it was a dream come true! I love and use the app almost every day! Unfortunately, there are bugs similar to the Kindle version. I'm in the middle of searching and finding the right pin when it just kicks me out! It doesn't do this as frequently as the Kindle app, but the problem is still there. Overall, I am happy with this app. If the bug was fixed, I would love it even more. That's all for now, I guess. |Version 4.5.1|4
Love it|I didn't understand the appeal of this app when it first came out but I grew to love it more than the other social image-sharing apps/services online. It's a great delivery platform to bookmark and sort things that inspire me, and also view related things automatically.  I hope they improve the accessibility of unfollowing specific things/people. I also wish they'd release a Windows version of the app. Still, way better than following tumblr feeds.|Version 4.5.1|4
Endless Ideas|My go-to place for creating ideas or enhancing my own.|Version 4.5.1|5
Amazing|If you are looking for something Pinterest has it....|Version 4.5.1|5

Great place to store, not sure about the adverts|Love the idea of my boards and it makes it easy to find ideas. I've noticed recently I'm getting advertisements and not really sure I like that. Will make a final decision on that in about another month. I've also noticed I can no longer pin from the clipboard...what's up with that??|Version 4.5.1|4
I LOVE Pinterest but...|Pinterest has recently become one of my favorite apps. I've become addicted. The problem is the app is glitching and won't allow me to sign in to my account. Please fix this soon!!! It's so annoying to have to go on Pinterest on safari because it doesn't work as well. Please make an update to fix this bug!!!|Version 4.5.1|1
Awesome|Helps me find things that I need|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it!|Pinterest is great! Overall I have very few complaints except that sometimes GIFs load after I pass them and play in front of other pins. That gets obnoxious. Besides that, I have one suggestion. What if we could add like reminders along with pins so that we can be reminded when to try a new workout or recipe or whatever? Then we wouldn't forget and wouldn't have to scroll through everything to find a specific pin when we think of it 8 days later... Just a thought :) great app!|Version 4.5.1|4

Like the app|I like the app great way to see different things that are out there you can do, wear or cook I would like it better if for the food that only you pin it you get the recipe to make it without have to click on another link to get to it.

Patti Bart|I love, love, love this app!!! Always on it and love everything about it!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Interest|Too many commercials to try and find your way to the picture or instructions, very frustrating.|Version 4.5.1|3
Problems with copy/paste from IG|Recently I've not been able to pin  the correct image of a link I already have copy share its URL from IG.  It happens that after doing so and opening my Pinterest app, when I click add a clipboard, the image that appears is my profile picture instead the image I previously copied its link from IG.  Weird!  It never happened before.  Does anybody else have noticed this?|Version 4.5.1|3
Yay Pinterest|I love it. If you've used the site, this is an excellent mobile version.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pentrist is awesome but,,,,|I love the ability to connect with so many people with like interests, but why won't they let us grab the pictures????|Version 4.5.1|4
Update|I like the new ideas and stuff. Some more things they could do are let us customize how our boards are put in order and for it to be easier somehow to organize our pins. Another super crazy idea that I'll totally understand if you don't wanna do this but it'd be cool if we could put boards inside boards! Just an idea.  I wish they didn't take away the little circles when you pin something that shows your boards instead o the pin, send, and like button.|Version 4.5.1|4
Thank you|Thank you to my friends who introduced me to this wonderful site.  Although I thought it would share more how to diy instructions.   But I'm new an maybe I haven't figured how to work it yet.  None the less I love this site. Thx pin tress|Version 4.5.1|5
New update|I loooove Pinterest! The app is at its best right now! Never crashes, easy and fast to repin, and full of inspiration!|Version 4.5.1|5
DIY Addiction|For those that enjoy making things yourself, Pinterest is addicting. This app is easy to use and keeps you filled with details about whatever your project needs.|Version 4.5.1|4
Boards|I don't know if I'm the only one that's noticed this.. But not all of the stuff I pin goes onto my boards! It's annoying when I lose stuff!|Version 4.5.1|3
Great ideas|There is much good stuff going on here. Whatever your interest is you can most likely find a great site to follow. Plus all the individual people with wonderful things to share.  Plus there's lots of great ideas|Version 4.5.1|5

Such an ingenious concept|When I first found Pinterest I thought it was a good past time app to play with fun ideas . It is so much more. I save projects. Find dinner ideas. And even renovated my home using ideas. It is a networking and holiday celebrating tool as well. Do not know how I managed without it.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love Pinterest|A website where i can collect ideas, present ideas, and keep them all organized. I like how I can share them with friends and I can follow boards of information I love !!!|Version 4.5.1|5

Pinterest|Pinterest is awesome|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome app!!|Very user friendly!|Version 4.5.1|5
Promoted pins|Please discontinue promoted pins on home feed.|Version 4.5.1|1
Most fun ap!|Love it!|Version 4.5.1|5
Last eat version|How come on the app we can't add personal photographed pins from our camera roll? The older older older version made it possible, but now I can't find that anywhere unless I do it via web...?!? Please fix!!! :(|Version 4.5.1|1
I LOVE IT|I love Pinterest but I have an idea you should be able to have boards inside boards|Version 4.5.1|5
App is great, but...|The app works great, but my 1-star is because every time someone sends you a pin, and you click the "see pin" email - you can't just quickly view that pin as your browser opens up. You have to 'choose' between app or browser, without having the ability to set a default.|Version 4.5.1|1
I used to love it|I hate this new update. I've stopped using Pinterest in almost aspect. I used to love it but now the setup is too difficult to use.|Version 4.5.1|2
Great app|I like it because it gives great ideas and information on how to build it|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it, but.....|I love getting new ideas from Pinterest! I haven't had many problems with it and I have found some great activities to do with my kids and some beautiful things to make for my home. It would have more ⭐️'s except that some links are found to be incorrect or unavailable. Also as many others pointed out, the auto refresh and sponsored/suggested links are annoying. Once those things are fixed, it will be perfect!|Version 4.5.1|3
Nice App|The app thus far has been really helpful for organizing my ideas, however really frustrating when the homepage is refreshed each time I look at a pin page. Would be nice if this flaw could be corrected.|Version 4.5.1|4
Pinterest|I love Pinterest it is fabulous|Version 4.5.1|4
|Great tool to find new things to learn and do. Also a good way to keep in touch with hobbies and sharing ideas.|Version 4.5.1|5
Mostly ADS to garbage|Used to be great when it was just people using it. Now every other pin is a "promoted" pin, more often than not leading to a spam site or click-bait. Still enjoyable but you have to watch out!|Version 4.5.1|2
Love it|I am really loving this app.|Version 4.5.1|5
LOVEEE ITTT!!!|Love it!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|I love all the different thing to see daily.|Version 4.5.1|5

Best app ever|Not a day in my life I have gone without spending hours on Pinterest looking at anything and everything out there|Version 4.5.1|5
Love this app!|Fantastic food ideas!|Version 4.5.1|5
If it ain't broke, don't "fix" it!|THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for going back to the old way of quick pinning!! So much better!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Auto-refresh|Please, get rid of the auto-refresh or at least give us the option to turn it off. It's really annoying, Jesus Christ.|Version 4.5.1|1
Want to zoom in|Wish I could zoom in to look at items. Other than that, I really like it.|Version 4.5.1|5
lovely app!|almost no complaints, it was beautifully created and very simple to use. I am very happy with how this app was designed and it has zero crashing issues that I have experienced so far!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|Love it use it everyday I've found some amazing recipes and hair tips from Pinterest!|Version 4.5.1|4
App|Great app|Version 4.5.1|5
I was reluctant, but...|I eventually jumped on the bandwagon when a client required it. I'm impressed to say the least. Pintrest does a fantastic job curating content for me when I'm in a time-wasting mood, and research for DIY projects couldn't be easier. I should have signed up years ago.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|Great App times out a little to much but I love Pinterest|Version 4.5.1|5
Kicked off of app|I keep getting kicked off the app whenever I'm pinning. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or a crash but this have been happening for a while now. Other then that, it's actually a pretty good app. There's nothing wrong with it at all, I say just keep it the way that it is. Just please, stop the crashes. Thank you.|Version 4.5.1|3
FIX THIS PLEASE|All of a sudden a lot of the pictures on my feed aren't showing up. I'll wait for a few minutes and they still wont show up. It also happens on the search engine. Really annoying me and I've tried everything even deleting the app but really need my Pinterest back...|Version 4.5.1|5
Amazing!!!|Very useful app, loving it !!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Fix it!|Constantly crashes.|Version 4.5.1|1
Gotta love it|I enjoy looking at all the different things,love to put in something off the wall just to see what pops up|Version 4.5.1|5
Strong concept, decent implementation|I thoroughly enjoy the Pinterest concept, but the home feed has gone seriously downhill since I started using it. The suggested posts are annoying and there are lots of notifications for things I don't care about. On the whole, it's quite useful for idea sharing and documenting, but some of the features need some work.|Version 4.5.1|4
Pinterest|I love this app. Use it for recipes, knitting, crocheting, and sewing.  Love to keep up with friend's interests.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|I like it and fun|Version 4.5.1|4
Love it but crash|I love Pinterest and will continue to use it but since the newest update it crash so much more than it ever did before. The update made it worse. Pleas fix this, it is very annoying.|Version 4.5.1|3
love and stuff|Pinterest is my main squeeze. always getting my back and stuff, making me feel like I can do anything love ya pal|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it!|This is an amazing App.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest Rocks- especially as a teacher|Love the app! So much fun! Nice way to find so many ideas for meals and especially for lesson plan ideas, it's really helpful to find things to use in my classroom.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|Pretty awesome|Version 4.5.1|5
Doing as advertised|Easy to use.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|It works perfect and I love doing it I would say if you like DIYS etc. this is the right app for you  You can also do it online ( on computer )|Version 4.5.1|5
I love the Pinterest App!|This app works great and has a lot of convenient features for pinning and sending pins through the messenger. I love it!!!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
I'm in love|I've had this app forever and I have loved it all along. It's kind of addicting, but it's worth it. Plus it's really good for finding outfits and hairstyles.|Version 4.5.1|4
Pretty happy with the app|The app in general is pretty good, but for a couple issues.  Recently it has become difficult to pin from other apps, so you have to open the link I'm Safari to get Pinterest to recognize am image. No major issue, just adds an additional step that wasn't necessary before recent updates.  The search function within your own pins leaves quite a bit to be desired, as it never pulls up all of the pins with the keyword, more like 60% of the pins. Other than those minor issues,  the Pinterest app works well and it's convenience means I access it mostly from my phone now.|Version 4.5.1|4
Awesome App|Really great ideas on here. Love it|Version 4.5.1|5
User-friendly and fun|Great app that allows for function of full site but mobile friendly.|Version 4.5.1|5
Great App / very useful|Great App / very useful|Version 4.5.1|5
I HEART PINTEREST|I love spending hours finding ways take credit for other people's ideas :)|Version 4.5.1|5
Superior!!|Everything I need in one place!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Yeah|Great way to de stress|Version 4.5.1|5
Love this!|I spend more time on this than any other app. The pictures and creative ideas are the best. I just can't say enough about it|Version 4.5.1|5
Where is the "Add a Pin" button?|I noticed a while back that the add a pin button was missing, however if I copied an address and then opened the app, it would ask me if I want to pin that link. Now, there seems to be no option of adding new pins. I thought my app or phone needed updating and have done that, but to no avail. I agree with others that I hate the sponsored and picked for you pins. Why follow anyone? I don't see their pins because of the spam clutter.|Version 4.5.1|3
Afable|La aplicación no me ha dado mayor problema, encuentro imágenes muy curiosas y es entretenida.|Version 4.5.1|4
Love this app|I love this app. I use it to look up recipes, nail designs, and hair style ideas.|Version 4.5.1|5
Amazing app!|I'm so In love with this app! I get on this everyday|Version 4.5.1|5
Addicted to Pintrest!|There is no limit to the information & ideas available on Pintrest.  Love it!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Better than google image search engine!|I find more of what i am looking for. On point!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love Pinterest, but...|I am not seeing my friends pins as much as I am seeing the " picked for you" pins, and there is far too much fat shaming and sponsored ads for weight loss, I don't like that. Other than that, it's a great app! I spend a lot of time pinning.|Version 4.5.1|4
Interesting|I could say, it's a fun and cool app. You can see interesting stuff such as ancient art, modern art, and many, many more!|Version 4.5.1|4
Mental organiser|This has been a powerful tool for creative expression.|Version 4.5.1|5
Small suggestion...|First and foremost, I love Pinterest! When I click to view a pin, a lot of the times I accidentally touch the picture and it brings up the website. (Which is a great feature) but, not always do I want to go that far, sometimes I just want to look at the expanded pin. It's very very touchy. Maybe you can make it so you have to double tap to see the pins website? Instead of a simple touch. Because I'm doing this all the time, and it's just a bit frustrating. But thanks for an amazing app! Hope this suggestion gets read|Version 4.4.1|5
I just wanted to be the 2000th review|That's all. I'm just cool like that I guess. Don't really even use this app too often. But it's great!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love|Pinterest app is great!!|Version 4.5.1|5
New Pinterest|The Gifs no longer indicate that they are Gifs, the app keeps crashing, and the notifications are all screwed up. If I could un-update the app, I would in a heart beat|Version 4.5.1|1
Greatest website ever|Pinterest is the most amazing website ever. From finding hair styles, craft ideas for kids, practical organizational ideas, gift ideas and recipes - you can literally find it all and organize it into folders where you can easily look up back and find without hassle!|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest is Awesome!!|I wanted to check out what Pinterest was all about, so I did... They have fabulous clothing blogs, beauty stuff like hair, nails; I even looked up ideas for my daughters communion!  Pinterest is so easy to use everybody should check out this website!      Just about all the pictures shown are linked to the "product or pictures" website. That's what's so great about it, it's not just a picture people post, you have information to get that product or the teachings from the post shows how to even braid your daughters hair! Anything you want to find just search for it and it gives you examples and poof, all these ideas show up that you can link to for you! Nothing you have to buy into! Definitely check this site out, it doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Great Ideas!|Full of many neat ideas. I like the convenience of the mobile app|Version 4.5.1|4
Great|Love it, love it, love it.|Version 4.5.1|5
Amazing! But how about this...|I LOVE Pinterest. I go there any time I have free time and I pin eeeeeverything I can get my hands on, but something I think that would be so cool is what if we could do folders in folders? I have about 4.6k pins and it's starting to get a little hard to find things. For example, in my food folder if I want to find smoothies I have to go through 600 pins, but if I could make sub folders like "smoothies" "snacks" "salads" etc. I think that would be soooo great!!! Thank you for the great app|Version 4.5.1|4
Cute|A must have app for my iPhone.|Version 4.5.1|5
6 star app|BEST APP ON MY IPHONE|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|I love the click-hold-options appear feature of the app, if only the website version had it too! Makes me a pinning machine!|Version 4.5.1|5
I enjoy Pinterest|The app is great but as others have said the auto refresh is annoying. Also there are a lot of sponsored ads that make it hard to find other things.|Version 4.5.1|3
Absolutely love it!|I love all the categories and can really get lost in it. The only thing I do not like, is the fact that you can't save an image..you have to do a screenshot and then take the extra time to edit it. That's my only complaint and the reason for 4 stars.|Version 4.5.1|4
One of my FAV APPs|One of the best apps I've ever used. I get great ideas here and have made many connections.|Version 4.5.1|5
Fantastic App!! Totally Love!|Great filing system for all my favs!|Version 4.5.1|5
Great source|Easy to use good source for new and different ideas and items|Version 4.5.1|5
Best app ever.|I have never wasted so much time in my life as I do on Pinterest. They have so many recipes and resources for teachers. I'm in love.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pretty Dang Awesome|This is like my favorite thing to do in my spare time. But I don't like that all of a sudden there are wayyy to many "picked for you" pins. And I think it would be great to be able to switch your boards between private and public. Overall this app is amazing though!!!!!|Version 4.4.1|4
Love|I absolutely love Pinterest it is my favorite app I have ever downloaded!!! It's so much fun. And it's safer than instagram or Facebook because you don't post stuff about yourself or others. Mainly most people post recipes or home decor or funny pictures. This is the best app ever!!!!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
I'm addicted|This is probably my favorite app ever!!!!  No Joke It is so much fun. There is something for everybody.My Aunt to my Brother love Pinterest. For the boys there is tons of funny things. And for fashion loving people this is your app, there is also tons of fun DIYS!  Love it!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️|Version 4.5.1|5

Nice|Love the app. Very user friendly, shows me everything I like...|Version 4.5.1|5
AWESOME|Love the app. Simplistic & Appealing!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Welcome to your new addiction!!|Seriously you've been warned!|Version 4.5.1|5
Please fix !|I love Pinterest! But on some of my boards they do not show all the tips! Please fix , I have tried everything! So awesome, just needs some bug fixes! ❤️ thanks!|Version 4.5.1|2
A dream come true; an original member & top fan.|While I'm not in love with the latest innovations of making suggestions about what Pinterest thinks I would like, or guessing which board I would pin to next-- I can say as a visual artist... This is the best innovation to come since the Internet.  I love it.  It is also still underestimated by social media.  Pinterest isn't going anywhere.  Happy Pinner!|Version 4.5.1|5
So many ideas!|I'll never have time to do them all but I have no excuse to be bored, ever.|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome|!|Version 4.5.1|5
FlySTL|Really, like this site. Lots of great ideas!  The new upgrade allowing to change and edit, the boards, from your mobile device, was a great improvement; thank you!  The only reasons I don't yet give 5 stars, are: First, and most importantly: the App freezes after 15-20 minutes of use. I need to either reboot, or log off the site for 45- 60 minutes before it corrects it's self.  I've tried deleting the App and reloading, several times.  Didn't help. This is extremely irritating!  Second: after being on the site for a short time, the pins begin repeating themselves. Again, I must log off for several hours, before finally new pin are displayed.  Please fix this problems. Other than that,   Wonderful!|Version 4.5.1|4
Pretty good!|I really enjoy this app, though it takes up a lot of my time. Anyway, overall it's a nice way to meet new people, and find things you love!|Version 4.5.1|4
Cool app|I like the ideas on here|Version 4.5.1|5
So addictive!|Love it!|Version 4.5.1|5
I love it|You like it because it gives you so many ideas and for example I had no idea what to give my dad but I looked on Pinterest and I had the perfect idea.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love|Best app ever|Version 4.5.1|5
Overbearing Ads|I love Pinterest but it lately has been mostly ads. I would gladly pay some money to avoid seeing them all the time. The ads wouldn't be a problem if I don't see the same one every five minutes. Especially for annoying t-shirts about nursing. I find my self constantly hiding the suggested pins because I've seen them before.   THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED.|Version 4.5.1|2
Fun|I love looking at Pintrest when I don't want rouse my brain to think about the day|Version 4.5.1|5
The best|I love this app every time you entering is something new not the same old Lane stuff I love it two thumbs up and a five star rating|Version 4.5.1|5
Absolutely Addictive!|The Pinterest app is absolutely addictive! No problems so far...|Version 4.5.1|5
Great app|Very useful for any ideas you have, need, or want.|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome!|I love pinterest. I find so many great ideas for myself and my family. :)|Version 4.5.1|5
Love Pinterest!|I'm addicted!|Version 4.5.1|5
So addicting!!!! :)|I can't seem to do my homework cause pintrest just calls to me. I look at it everyday!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Tis Good|Pinterest is an opportune app where self expression is beautiful. I really enjoy the group boards where you can collectively build on ideas. I also love the visual understanding I can find with other pinners. I wish there could be some sort of back drop photo on profiles, but I've managed without that. :) It makes me sad to see people abusing this app with pornography and other clearly inappropriate pins, so I'm glad there is a way to report this instances.  Until next time, Keep on pinning!|Version 4.5.1|5
Shared board problems|I have a lot of shared boards and for about the last month it is no longer sending me notifications when shared member add pins or comments. It's very frustrating! Sometimes it will send a notification or show a red bubble with the number of notifications but when clicked on there is nothing there so I have to search for the pin or comment. This is difficult with so many pins and boards! Makes us want to stop using the app all together.|Version 4.5.1|2
I just love it!!!|It's my favorite app!!! You can find everything here.|Version 4.5.1|5
Great app!|Love being able to save something I'm interested in so I can read it later! And go back to tutorials without having to search for it all over again!|Version 4.5.1|4
Great one ☺️|I love this app|Version 4.5.1|5
Yooo✌️|I love Pinterest, but the app keeps on crashing while I'm pinning!|Version 4.5.1|4
Could be better|Love Pinterest and the whole concept behind it, but when someone pins a YouTube video and you watch it within the app, afterwards it's really buggy and glitchy and I wind up having to close the app down to continue looking. Another problem I keep having is scrolling along through feeds and accidentally sending random pins to people. There has to be an easy way to prevent that.  Also, I'm drowning in ads. I don't mind the occasional one, seeing as how I am using a free service, but my feed is being taken over by spam :/|Version 4.5.1|2
Like it|Realmente me encanta esta app... Ayuda mucho a ver nuevas tendencias|Version 4.5.1|5
Works fine|No specific complaints. Very similar to using the online site.|Version 4.5.1|4

Outstanding|3 words. Awesome. Amazing. Fantastic.|Version 4.5.1|5
I'm a pin addict.|I love Pinterest. I look at it at least once a day. Although I'm really tired of seeing 'pins inspired by'. I have hand picked the boards of my friends I want to follow. I don't appreciate having my feed filled with things that Pinterest feels I need based on boards I have. Maybe it can be an option, to turn on and off, for people that do or don't like it.|Version 4.5.1|4

Pinterest review|I spend a little too much time on this app. It's addictive. Only problem is sometimes it will abruptly exit out. That's a bit annoying.|Version 4.5.1|4
Love it!|So many things so little time|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome!|I like looking at new decorating ideas and trying new recipes. What a great concept!|Version 4.5.1|5

It's the best!|Pinterest is the best, can't say anything more.|Version 4.5.1|5
Most annoying app ever|If I want to download I quick! Stop trying to force people to download the app it's very annoying. If I even click on a pin it automatically redirects me to the App Store. & if you chose not to download don't even think about using the web version, you pretty much can't. Idk why I feel bullied into downloading app but I refuse to because I don't agree with the way you do things.|Version 4.5.1|1
The only place to go|Pinterest is the one stop website for me. It's easy, convenient, and fun to use. I spend hours learning how to be more creative!|Version 4.5.1|5
Best app ever!|There are so many amazing and brilliant and amazingly simple ideas here! How could you not love it? I was seriously addicted right away. You never have to think again. Just go onto Pinterest and whatever problem you have can be solved|Version 4.5.1|5

Pinterest Crash!!|My Pinterest app is not letting me sign in. I normally go in through Facebook, but recently I've started having problems so I tried going in through Google and the problem still occurs! I deleted the app at least four times reset my data usage turn off the data usage for Pinterest and still no luck! This has been happening for at least a week or two now! I really need Pinterest app to start back working! Help Me!!!!!|Version 4.5.1|1
Love it!|Looks like they reverted the update that was annoying me :) 5 stars now. App is better than the website and predicts the board you're going to pin something to. Usually pretty accurate :)|Version 4.5.1|5
Love, except!|Love the App, except Please get rid of the "Promote and Suggested Pins for" don't care for the updates on "How Many/Boards" My Fellow Pinners do:-(|Version 4.5.1|4
Disappointed|At one time I loved using Pinterest yet now some 90-95% of my feed is "picked for you". I rarely get to see those that I actually follow in my feed any longer. Losing interest swiftly. Wish there was a way to change back to those I truly follow rather than filling with unsolicited pins.|Version 4.5.1|2
Good app for sharing|Overall this works well for sharing your pins. Graphics look good and are easy to read on my iPad Mini 3.|Version 4.5.1|5
I'll always remember the good days|I've used Pinterest for a few years now and of course I love it, but now the ads are getting absolutely out of control. PINTEREST PLEASE STOP PUTTING UP SO MANY ADS! It's frustrating because I don't need suggestions and I never repin or enjoy the ads. They're unnecessary. Eventually I may stop using the app altogether to avoid them.|Version 4.4.1|3
Pinterest|Good info, really enjoy the categories for referencing too|Version 4.5.1|5
LOVE!!!|I love this app! Amazing ideas and you can find basically anything :)|Version 4.5.1|5
Hate the new update !!|I love Pinterest but hate the way the app is heading.I don't want to see things that are "picked" for me or promoted pins. I want to see the things I'm following. Also where the hell did the add pin feature go?? I want to be able to add pins from my phone. BRING THIS BACK!!|Version 4.5.1|1
Great app|I was very skeptical about getting it since it was mostly women stuff. However, after seeing some posts I knew I needed it. Great app with so much variation. Highly recommended|Version 4.5.1|5
Love!!!!!!!!!!!|Perfect app!! I love it!!|Version 4.5.1|5
It allows me to lay out my dreams|Pinterest allows me to lay out my dreams in an organized way! I draw inspiration from this little app. |Version 4.5.1|5
It actually helps me sleep at night.|Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....|Version 4.5.1|5
Awesome|Everything you'll ever need|Version 4.5.1|4
Best Social Media Ever.|This is, and forever will be my favorite social media. I have not gotten into bad situations on Pinterest, it's is the most appropriate social media ever. I've met awesome friends. And I love it :)|Version 4.5.1|5

Crashes|The trouble I have with this app is after I pin 4-5things it crashes, and I totally lose spot on where I was.. Please fix this so I can enjoy the app.. I have the iPod 5|Version 4.5.1|4
Seriously?|I love Pinterest, but I've noticed that some stuff could be changed, and I see other people asking for it too. First order of business, I blocked someone, and they were still able to pin my pins from my own boards. I ask you kindly put an end to this.  Next, would you be so kind as to allow those of us a choice as to weather we want our boards in a random order or not. None of us can find our own boards! Please consider adding a choice to have them arranged alphabetically, please. We, the People, love orderliness. Lastly, if we hide someone who was contacting us, can you make it so we can "show" them again? I find this most frustrating. Thank you for your consideration.|Version 4.5.1|2
Pinterest is GREAT!!!!!|I really love this app.  Very helpful|Version 4.5.1|4
Ideas|This app is a kaleidoscope of ideas!|Version 4.5.1|5

Not happy|Why isn't the app letting me in its already logged in but it won't show any pins or boards it's making me mad|Version 4.5.1|1
Great app.|I'll admit when I first got the app I didn't expect to use it very often. I was wrong. I love to use it to look up crafts for my students.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|Love, love, love it!!. |Version 4.5.1|5
App quits|Love the app but it quits unexpectedly a lot, especially just when I'm about to pin something.|Version 4.5.1|5
Good tool|Enjoy pinning. There needs to be a filter of what can pop up when you enter. I don't want my kids seeing topless women in the name of "photography".|Version 4.5.1|4
|Omg|Version 4.5.1|5
Love/Hate new Pinterest|I love the app but am VERY tired of it CONSTANTLY crashing and loosing my spot and the amount of spam now is crazy,I would give all 5 stars if you could PLEASE fix these issues and mark pins that are truly spam,that way others know that the Link/Pin is broke or spam..|Version 4.5.1|3

I love Pinterest|I spend so much time on this app.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest|It's great, I like it!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love and like|My only complaint is I don't appreciate how I look things up online and app automatically comes up. Sometimes I multi-task and I don't like it when I have to switch back to online version.|Version 4.5.1|4
Works great!!|awesome dream board love it!!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Great App; One Main Issue|Pinterest- I love your app, but every time I lock my phone, answer a text etc. my photo feed auto refreshes, and I have to scroll through 100 pins to get back to my browsing place. It makes me want to punch people in the face.|Version 4.5.1|4
Addictive|Stop! Go back!  There's still time to save yourselves. Don't start! This is just waaay too addicting! The only problem I have is my app crashes about every 20 minutes or so, but to be fair it's probably the fault of my rickety old outdated iPhone 4s.|Version 4.5.1|5
Too touchy|I love this app, except it's to touchy. I'm scrolling down my feed and it jumps to a new "page" ie. Profile, notifications, search. Besides that, I totally dig the new features.|Version 4.5.1|4
App just crashes|So disappointed in Pinterest lately. These related pins are annoying as all get out. And each and every time I click the X and say hide all pins inspired by this board the app crashes and signs me out. Every time. So they either can't create a functioning app or they just don't want people to hide pins. Getting sick of Pinterest shoving crap in my face that I don't want.  Oh and somehow my phone has decided to automatically update. We all know what that means. The new version simply crashes non stop.|Version 4.5.1|2
Great app|Love the hair section and the accessibility of the app|Version 4.5.1|4
Addicted|Quick and convenient. Love that I have easy access to great wardrobe ideas!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it!|Finally the board suggestion works well for me: the first one is the most recent board I used, the second and third board are generated by some machine learning algorithm, and the result is pretty accurate for the most of the time. I can't believe how much time it saves me!! Pinterest has been experimenting on this for a long time and I'm really glad that they come up with a NICE solution! Good job, team!|Version 4.5.1|5
Loving this app!!!|Since I've started this app, I have been at it. There's so much info here. Just about anything that you are interested in, you can find it here. I love it!!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love this app!|This is where i got to see new things, new fashion and GOD's beautiful flowers. But there is some bugs that needs to be fix. And hope we can zoom in the picture.Please do something about it. Thanks:)|Version 4.5.1|5
Failed words source|There were times my words failed me to express my intent, and the I found your words that matched my deeper feeling.  I would read and think what is this like in my mind and my block would be removed and I would write again what was in my heart that lined up to be in print.  Thank you.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pumped!!|I LOVE Pinterest! It has helped me so many times at birthday parties, Holiday functions and even redecorating bathrooms & outdoor projects. It's such an easy way to share ideas and cost friendly DIY projects!|Version 4.5.1|5
I love Pinterest but would love it more if...|1) you would let me arrange the order of pins on my boards and 2) you would stop picking so many pins for me. I barely can find the pins from those that I want to see because they are hidden in the mass of "picked for you" pins, most of which I don't care to see.|Version 4.5.1|3
Great app|Lots of info and fun. The formatting is quite clever and smart|Version 4.5.1|5
Vn|Vn|Version 4.5.1|5
Could be better|Auto refresh is the most annoying feature yet! I want to look at what's on there when I first open it but I never can. And the app NEVER loads all the pins. Wifi or not, it seems every other pin won't load when searching and scrolling....|Version 4.5.1|2
My favorite app!|I love this app. Has been & will probably always be the most frequently used app on my iPad.|Version 4.5.1|5
Pinterest has my Interest...|App is great!!! Def useful. I'm on here just about everyday getting ideas for my sisters baby shower. I  Pinterest!|Version 4.5.1|5
Best of best|Best place to share everything worth sharing|Version 4.5.1|5
Okay|App works great but I can't say I'm happy about all of the "picked for you" pins. They clutter up my feed.|Version 4.5.1|3
Love Pinterest!|The app is OK. For what I do with it it works fine. It's just so easy to get hung up on it and spend a lot of time!|Version 4.5.1|5
Careful what you "pin" for|Like anything else, Pinterest is not perfect--but close! Sometimes I get more than I wanted so it takes quite an effort to "unfollow" as I get unwanted contacts. For themes toasty though I LOVE Pinterest--even with defects!|Version 4.5.1|4
Love it|I absolutely love this app!|Version 4.5.1|5
Redirects WITHOUT permission|Stop redirecting me to this app without my permission. I deleted the app hoping the redirect madness would stop. Now it is even more of a nightmare but I refuse to use the app until this is resolved. I now find myself avoiding clicking on Pinterest links! When I want to use Pinterest I GO TO PINTEREST. When I want to do searches for GENERAL ideas/items I use a search engine and don't want the flow to be interrupted by being sent out to an app in an endless redirect loop when I attempt to return to my browser. Pinterest works fine on an iPad without the app. Make redirects a CHOICE in settings for those of us that don't want it. Pinterest is no longer a place I want to visit.|Version 4.5.1|1
Decent app|Only reviewing so it will stop asking. Not a huge user, but it's a helpful app.|Version 4.5.1|3
Love to PIN..|I'm a Pintrest Fan... My  go-to for ideas.... Wish i could have more secret boards, please add the feature.  Download it! Pin it! Have Fun|Version 4.5.1|5
Great app but....|The random force closing of this app drives me bonkers. Here I am, minding my own business, pinning things I love and then *BLIP*, the app just shuts off. Soooo annoying. If you could fix that, I'd give you five stars instead of four. Otherwise, I LOVE IT!|Version 4.5.1|4
Great app|I love this app, everything about it is wonderful.|Version 4.5.1|5
Hey|Cool app very easy to use and I enjoy it very much, just add a few more category's and it will be complete lol have a great day.

Great app|You can find anything on this app. Great recipes, ideas to redecorate. Grrat quote.|Version 4.5.1|5
Good app|I'm very interesting in this app.|Version 4.5.1|5

Addicted|Wow I love this app!!! My best friend got me addicted and i love her for that!!!!! ❤️❤️|Version 4.5.1|5
:-(|If I pin 10 things in one folder, only 3 show up. When I refresh, the other 7 show up but never all ten at the same time. So, I can't see what I'm doing and I have no idea what other people see.  I've tried re uploading but now there seem to be duplicates I can't get to.    Lately I have seen problems like never before on Pinterest. It's always crashed, kicked me out, all that...but it's getting so bad now that it's barely functional.   Last two updates now, btw, the save button doesn't show up. Not a problem for me because I know where it is but a new user will not know to click in the blank space.   Also, notifications say someone mentioned you in a pin or commented on your pin but when I click nothing is there. I have, inadvertently, come across several messages I never knew about or ones I couldn't find after searching. And yes, my settings are all adjusted to receive notifications.   Another thing...I can no longer see where a pin came from. I used recent pins as a link guide to other users pages.  Now I have no practical way to find who I want to find. Following does no good because ...who can possibly remember every name and which name goes with which pin, it's not even alphabetical.  I also use to find additional interesting people by noticing where a pin came from. I'm betting you have seen a decrease in repins since last update removed this.  Workaround, brace yourself...this is really practical....I now take screenshots of a users page and upload to a private folder for quick mental access, which gives me the name... I can then either do a manual search or dig through my following list for half an hour.  Formerly, I could just click on a pin and it would take me there. Not sure why you wld remove the social aspects of a social media site. This discourages ppl from following ppl back bc it overwhelms and adds to what you have to dig through, maybe that was the point. Who knows? There shld be a way for us to access the pages we want to frequent without having to unfollow and refollow so they will appear at the top.|Version 4.5.1|1
COOL|Awesome app for pictures!!|Version 4.5.1|5
Hate it, hate it!|I don't use the website because is super annoying! You cannot see a single picture without taking forcing you to the App Store to download the app... I don't like the app is annoying too.|Version 4.5.1|1
Works well for what I need it for|Not as smooth as just going to the site, but when I want a quick tip, or feel like I need to pin on the go, it does the trick.|Version 4.5.1|4
Please read !!!|Wow it is awesome I love it bc it has a lot of great recipes and the jokes make me laugh lol so I just adore it so much so it's just really a cool app and it expelly has jokes for kids,teens,ect and the recipes sound so yummy yumm|Version 4.5.1|5

I LOVE PINTREST however…|When I am in the app it stops working and sends me out of the app. I don't know if it my phone acting up or a bug that needs to be fixed. Other than GREAT app!|Version 4.5.1|5
What is this???|Go back to the old design. I can organize my own pins. That was the whole point of Pinterest. You idiots.|Version 4.5.1|1
this isn't the image i wanted to see|...add a link somewhere near to top of this app's description that will reopen mobile safari.|Version 4.5.1|1
Too many bugs|Pinterest has become one of my favorite apps this year as I am planning a wedding. However, it's also become one of the most frustrating apps. I have many shares bored with my bridesmaid since we pin different ideas for the wedding and bridal shower. However, it's become very annoying when my phone tells me I have a notification from Pinterest and when I check it in the app it's no where to be found. It becomes very frustrating to share boards and ideas when you don't know where and what everyone is pinning. It defeats the purpose of having a notification tab when you aren't able to get them on time.  Please fix this problem.|Version 4.5.1|2
Addicted!|Love it!! I have made many of the great recipes tried a lot of the home remedies etc|Version 4.5.1|5
awesome and get app|it's a great app to find stuff and to have some ideas about stuff love it love love it‼️‼️✔️✔️|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it|I find so many great ideas to use in my classroom, at home and the in between! Love Pinterest|Version 4.5.1|5
I love it but I have two wishes|I favor Pinterest above all apps even Facebook. It would be awesome if the app. allowed the board owner to rearrange the content in the boards they create. Also lets have adult verification and settings so I can have hot guys in my boards without offending someone's mom because their kid is looking at my sexy guy pics. Tumbler trumps Pinterest regarding that last issue.|Version 4.5.1|4

Ok, but...|I LOVE Pinterest, and I can't find many flaws. Except one major one that bugs me. Pinterest kicked me off of my account and won't let me log back in using the username and password that I had. Can someone fix that?!|Version 4.5.1|3
Bugs!|80% of the pictures on my home feed aren't showing. Please fix this problem|Version 4.5.1|5
Love this app!|Great app for anything and everything. Just make sure to find the right things and people|Version 4.5.1|5
Great but hard to search your own pins.|I just started using the iPhone app for recipes and it is so handy for meal planning and cooking! I definitely recommend it for moms. I would like it to be easier to search my own pins though.|Version 4.5.1|4
Awesome|Love it |Version 4.5.1|5

Love it!|Love love love Pintrest! ❤️|Version 4.5.1|5
I love Pinterest but the app could be improved|I'll start by saying I'd really like to rate this 3.5 stars but since I can't I'll just move on.  Anyway the app works great for searching for anything and everything on the go.  However sometimes my home screen never refreshes, or refreshes way too frequently.  Other than that considering this is a mobile app I personally don't see too much wrong with it aside from not being able to pin things from outside of the app.|Version 4.5.1|4
Excellent, with a surprising finish.|Full bodied, with light citrus overtones. Pairs well with venison.|Version 4.5.1|5
So much to love...maybe too much|I love Pinterest, and have a board for so many hobbies and different aspects of my life.  I appreciate the app updates that make pinning a little easier - such as the new memory and guessing functions.|Version 4.5.1|5
Love Pinterest!|So many great ideals!|Version 4.5.1|5
Inspiring|Love this app|Version 4.5.1|4
Love!|This version rocks! Love Pinterest!|Version 4.5.1|5
Enlightening & fun|I learn and get to experiment with many things from people all over the world. I love it!|Version 4.5.1|5
Love|The lay out of Pinterest was first overwhelming. Once you take the time to get used to it, you'll soon come to see that this app/site is pure genius. This is my first stop when looking for something and Google is second!|Version 4.5.1|5
Cool|Need to use it more.|Version 4.5.1|4
Stop bugging me|I didn't want to rate this thing, but Pinterest kept spamming me with requests to rate it.|Version 4.5.1|1
Love it!|Love, but hard that every time I look at a pin, when I close it, it doesn't take me back to where I was.|Version 4.5.1|4
|I love it|Version 4.5.1|5
Love it!|Great app.|Version 4.5.1|5
Please get rid of Picked for You|I do not want to see these random "picked for you" pins.  I hate looking at my feed now. Please let me pick who I want to follow.  If this was optional it would be fine.  I used to spend hours on Pinterest but now I'm annoyed after 5 minutes.  I don't enjoy it any more.|Version 3.1|1
Seriously, the next MySpace in the making!|•Oh, look. Another useless update designed to make all the negative reviews go away or to further degrade the Pinning experience.   •Intensely dislike related/suggested pins clogging up my board. You've taken away my ability to personalize Pinterest and now it's pointless to follow anyone at all.   •Auto-refresh interferes with the pinning experience.   •Stop forcing me into the app from my browser. Ask me first. You are the only app on my phone that doesn't. Rude. Anyone who has been caught in the vicious cycle of trying to exit out of Pinterest on Safari and being repeatedly sent to the app or the app store understands my frustration.  •Constant. Crashing.   A few more reasons why Pinterest isn't so much fun anymore is that so many of the pins are now spam, or send you to aggregating sites who've ripped off the original source or they're simply dead links. I find myself having to frequently search images on Google to find the original source of photos.|Version 4.5.1|1
❤️❤️❤️Love it!!!|I don't have a lot of apps and I'm not a social media person, but I LOVE this app!! So easy to use, so fun to try and easy to share!|Version 4.5.1|5
