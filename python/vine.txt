tags????|you can't tag anyone anymore like you used to! it's so annoying because if I find a funny vine and want to tag my friend the only way it lets you is if they commented, and you have to find their comment. love the update but please please please bring back the tags!!|Version 3.3.0|3

No Copy Link Feature|Come on Vine, stop trying to link up everything with social media! I just want to be able to share a vine by copying the link and sending via text message!|Version 3.3.0|1
Vine ruins everything|Vine, you went from first to worst. Quit over complicating your app. You took away simply commenting a name in a vine and simply revining a vine. Also, you do not follow your rules. People continue to purchase followers and do revine for revine them. Ban them! Or don't make those rules. Enforce them if you're gonna make rules. Very hypocritical.|Version 3.3.0|1
Pure Butt Water|Vine is trash now. Thanks to all those hairless monkeys making idiotic vines and those old people making people uncomfortable by hanging out with kids and making stupid vines. Do yourselves a favor and don't download this trash.|Version 3.3.0|1
Fix vine please|Ever since the update vine crashes every time I go in it! When I go on it it fades black then returns to home screen!|Version 3.3.0|3
No more "copy link"|This was the best part about Vine and with the recent update, this app is terrible and worthless. Will be deleting if "copy link" selection does not return soon. One of the worst updates I've seen within any app in a LONG time.|Version 3.3.0|1
Can't even open the app..|The app crashes as soon as I open it every time since the new update.|Version 3.3.0|1
Horrible|Horrible and buggy. Instead of making a more complicated share button, fix the fact that half the vines freeze. fix the fact that it constantly bugs out. and bring back copy link.|Version 3.3.0|1

New update is horrible|I hate that you got rid of the hashtag button and the @ button|Version 3.3.0|1
Ideas|The overall product is still great. But. I definitely agree that you should bring back the "copy link" option. And I would love to see an expansion of the trending topics. Why not, under each channel under Explore, there be a section of trending topics exclusively to that channel. If I clicked on Comedy, I could see the top 8 trending topics underneath that channel. I think that when maximize exposure of the topic.|Version 3.3.0|3
Can't tag people|The copy link thing is in upper right corner when u go into sharing options.. But I can't figure out how to tag friends in a post now and it's pissin us all off cuz none of us can figure it out.. That needs to be fixed right now|Version 3.3.0|4

New Update, No Fix.|I love this app. For the most part. But could there be an option that allows us to CHOOSE to allow double-tap to like? Switch it on or off? Because I don't like it. I don't want it. But I can't get rid of it.|Version 3.2.1|1
copy link|currently wishing I hadn't updated, copy link was my main way of sharing vines.|Version 3.3.0|1
Vines|U need to be able to share with Instagram also that should be ur next update|Version 3.3.0|5
Please fix|Okay so I just got the new update and I regret it I can't make edits now because I can't copy the link to get audio but I still see everyone else making edits and I asked them how do they do edits with the new update and nobody replied so please fix this I wanna make edits so badly but I can't!!! |Version 3.3.0|2
Awful|I can't tag people in comments or posts, the whole update is confusing. If I could rate this app id give it -0 stars. Great job. |Version 3.3.0|1
New Feature Suggestion|I'm a huge fan and avid user of Vine. This is pretty much the sole social networking app I use, I love the creative community of people and the overall format of the app. I was just wondering if it was possible to have a feature in the that enables the user to view another user's vines that they "liked."   For example, if I go on Meagan Cignoli's  account, I'd see options to view 1) Meagan's posts 2) Meagan's likes  & 3)Meagan's vines that I've "liked"|Version 3.3.0|5
I don't like the update|I can't tag my friends in the comments anymore|Version 3.3.0|3
Bring back copy link|Do not get new update! Can't share with friends over text anymore|Version 3.3.0|1
Don't care for the new update at all|Now we have to manually go find the # to tag and there's no way to just share the link to the video anymore. What gives??? This makes me upset.|Version 3.3.0|1
COPY LINK|I give this app 1 star because the best part of the app is the copy link which you can't do anymore because of the update I can't even post the link to other apps or resources because there's no copy link.without it it is just a horrible new update just horrible.|Version 3.3.0|1
No More "Copy Link"????|C'mon Vine. It was so easy to just hit the "copy link" button and text my friends funny vines. Now you made it 100xs more complicated for no reason. Fix this.|Version 3.3.0|2
Go back to the 2013 1 click revines!|Go back to the 2013 1 click revines|Version 3.2.0|1
CRASH|Ever since the update, the app crashes constantly. And before the update, you could copy the link to a vine and it was easy to do so. I don't see that option anymore. But more importantly, the crash needs to be fixed. Other than that, love this app.|Version 3.3.0|2
AMAZING|I really like vine it's amazing I laugh my butt of when I see the vines but just one flaw and if they get rid of the flaw then it's gonna be prefect they should have a button where u can share to Instagram or save on ur camera roll plzz porfavoer  fix this and then it's gonna be perfect but for now I'm gonna rate it a 4 star app|Version 3.2.1|4
HELP!!!|How the hell do I copy the link of the vine!? Like before!? This new update is so stupid!!! Help please. I can't send vines to my friends anymore. And the new pop up thing to share is so stupid. Go back to the way it was beforr|Version 3.3.0|1
Groovy!|Just got the latest update. I LOVE IT!! Easier, sleeker ... very nice. |Version 3.3.0|5
FAIL UPDATE|I hate not being able to tag people in comments if I want to show them the vine. "Share with a friend" takes too long and it's pointless..|Version 3.3.0|2
Stop deleting accounts|I love this app, but the new update is terrible. There's no more @ or # bar, and the caption isn't its own place. And I absolutely hate the sharing idea. Basically, I hate the new update.|Version 3.3.0|2
Hehe|Rules:1) Give the new vine update a ONE NOT A 5  rating! Leave this cmnt on review:"Go back to the 2013 1 click revines" I'll follow! New vine update meh|Version 3.3.0|1
FANTASTIC APP... New Revine button is garbage! FIX!|Great app... Except y'all need to GO BACK TO the 2013 vine with 1 CLICK REVINES LIKE HOW IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING!!! |Version 3.3.0|1

Update|The updates just get worser and worser each time|Version 3.3.0|3
huh |Why does my vine load but then crash  it works fine on my iPod and it worked fine before |Version 3.3.0|1
terrible|vine gets worst with every update as a viner myself i think vine should go back to the old days and be like when it first started easy and simple thats what made vine so populae now its conplicated and lame|Version 3.3.0|1
333|Doesnt let me sign in? Anyone else have this problem??|Version 3.3.0|3
Horrible update|Great app but it's so confusing and hard to share it with people especially contacts not a good update|Version 3.3.0|3
Great|Love it|Version 3.3.0|5
Vine|Please go back to the original vine. The new update you just released is so stupid. Going back to the first vine update would be amazing!!|Version 3.3.0|5
Doesn't work!|It never updates! Please fix your app vine!|Version 3.3.0|1
Latest update crossed the line.|The new sharing feature is pretty and smooth but you took out many other sharing features. I can no longer send the vine via iMessage. Nor can I copy/paste the link!  P.S This is the first time I've ever had to write a review. This is just ridiculous.  - thanks  M|Version 3.3.0|1
Cancel button|Vine is my absolute favorite app, but there's just one thing that I absolutely HATE!  When I'm recording a vine or editing it and I decide to exit, I can almost NEVER press the X at the top. I don't know if it's just me or if it happens to everyone, but it's REALLY sensitive and there's like a 1 in a million chance I could ever press it. It's extremely annoying and it's the one thing I DREAD about vine. FIX IT PLEASE!!!!           Arigatoū,                    --SS|Version 3.3.0|4
WHY???|WHY the change? It was fine the way it was, what is the point of change all the time. Please put it back how it was. It's terrible now|Version 3.3.0|1
New sharing doesn't have Copy Link option?|It may be easier to share on social media now but what about just copying the link to the vine?? Need that option back!!|Version 3.3.0|1
CHANGE IT BACK|I don't like the new revine thing. It takes longer to revine! Please change it back to the way it used to be|Version 3.3.0|1
UPDATE IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS|i dont like this new update plz change it back, its much harder to revine vines, it was fine just the way it was before|Version 3.3.0|1
Crap. No one buy this app|This app is bs. One day I try to go to my camera roll try to upload a vid... And guess what vine crapped all over my 2.5.43 followers.|Version 3.3.0|1
One update idea|I think the app is great but there should be an update added where u can if someone has read your message and if they are replying.|Version 3.3.0|4
Why?|Why did you make it even more difficult to share a link via text? That's really the only way I share them. Was great to be able to quickly send it to someone by copying the link and pasting it into iMessages, but now you have to scroll all through you vine friends, then the people you follow and finally through your phone contacts before you can send it to them. Then it adds a dumb message before the link.|Version 3.3.0|1
Go back to the old vine plzzzzzzzzz|I liked how it was back in the day when I was able to refresh a revine every time I revined it. Also, when it was just a one click revine. Please go back to the old ways when Vine was awesome! These updates are starting to make Vine go downhill.|Version 3.3.0|1
Don't bother updating|One fatal flaw about this update is the sharing. Now it is impossible to copy a vine url to text a friend|Version 3.3.0|1
The Update is Confusing.|I am a huge fan on vine , but I recently updated the latest features and not really liking the idea. It's ok, but how do you copy links? There used to be an option but i can't seem to find it !|Version 3.3.0|2
Can't share|How come I can't share vines or copy to the clipboard?|Version 3.3.0|1
No more tags?!|There is usually a tag button but after I updated vine I can't use the hashtags please fix that plz!|Version 3.3.0|1
WHAT!?|What happened to vine!???? It was so much better when ur was just one click to revine. Now it has a dumb pop up. FIX THIS NOW|Version 3.2.1|1
No more SMS sharing?|So you've updated how we share vines and took away the simplest way of just copying the link or sending it in a text?|Version 3.3.0|1
Awesome App!|Vine is a fun, creative, and different way to enjoy media of all sorts. Vine is 100% worth getting, for it provides hours of fun, thinking, and creation.|Version 3.3.0|5
This update|Every update get's worst and worst.... Rus you follow me.... This update is slow af! Go back to the first one! Shoutout all the people that follow me on vine and say I'm ugly! Squad! #FREETHEGUYS|Version 3.3.0|1
This app needs to go back to the old ways|I liked how it was back in the day when I was able to refresh a revine every time I revine it. Also, when it was just a one click revine. Please go back go the old ways! These updates are starting to make Vine go downhill!|Version 3.3.0|1
Used to love the app, but all these updates are ruining the app!!|UPDATES CONSTANTLY RUINING THE APP, STOP MESSING WITH A GOOD THING, YOURE RUINING IT FOR VINERS!!|Version 3.2.1|1
BRING BACK THE SPORTS PAGE|Okay I know what u guys are thinking and I'm talking to vine. You still have the pop page, u do but there are only official accounts like what other people say,"warming up for today's game". Like who wants to watch that. I would someday like to make the sports page look at your ratings vine, your at 3 stars now and it's still going down, you have more 1 stars than 5 stars. Now all you have to do is bring it back and you can be one of the most famous apps again. Because now people are quitting vine. Thanks a lot vine *in a sarcastic way*. Bring back the sports page |Version 3.3.0|1
I need help!!!!|Ever since the new update I can't tag people in vines. Does anyone know how to fix that or is there a new way to tag people in vines.|Version 3.3.0|3
WE CANT SAVE VINES|WITH THIS NEW UPDATE WE CANT COPY THE LINK TO VINES OMG IM ABOUT TO STOP MAKING EDITS CAUSE YOU GUYS RUIN EVERYTHING! VINE WAS MY ONLY ESCAPE MAKING EDITS FOR WOLF BUT NOW I CANT THANKS SO MUCH FOR MY DEPRESSION COMING BACK|Version 3.3.0|1
Hate the new update|Kinda of a lot work to revine|Version 3.3.0|2
Liked the old version better|I personally liked the previous version more than this one|Version 3.3.0|3
Go back to the old version|I don't like that I can't copy my vines to my clip board any more please put the option back|Version 3.3.0|1
Why did you get rid of "copy link"?|So I like to make vine edits, but I get a lot of my audio from other viners (with permission) and I know a lot of other people do too. The problem is this requires the "Copy URL" option that this latest update got rid of and I'm really upset about that. Please put that back|Version 3.3.0|3
ight|its ok|Version 3.3.0|5
Love it but...|Love the app but you should really take away the "double tap to like" feature.|Version 3.3.0|4
It's hard to use hashtags now|I want the old feature were you could use the hashtag button|Version 3.3.0|1
Options|I don't like how the revine shows options now I just liked it when you just pushed in and it's just like revined. Also in the comments you can't put hashtags on it anymore which kind of bothers me because I would have to click where the numbers are and then click it again to actually find the little #I liked it how when it had the # on it and then you can't also put our username on there anymore which bothers me too in the comments so it really does bother me a lot. Fully you can add these features back to mine because I don't want the new version to it I mean it's good and all but I like the old version better than the new person|Version 3.3.0|1
So totally love this app|I spend all my life on it. Thanks ! C:|Version 3.3.0|5
I hate the update|I hate this new update. I don't know how to copy a link to save the vine now. thanks.|Version 3.3.0|1
Great app|This update is trash.|Version 3.3.0|2
Vive|Amazing|Version 3.3.0|5
It's good but...|I liked it when you can tag people and put # but now you can't. Someone needs to fix this|Version 3.3.0|4
Needs update|Crashes all the time|Version 3.3.0|1
share screen|what happened to the copy link option?? that's how I would share vines with my friends, not by clogging up my Twitter and Facebook accounts.|Version 3.3.0|1
Come On Vine|Vine seriously, what happened to the old vine where everyone liked to come and like and revine posts, now vine is nothing actually. No one goes on vine anymore and the revine button is even worse now! Barely anyone gets followers since no one is on vine and a ton of people who make actual vines quit because of no one watching them, in a couple of years vine will have less and less people, so think and make something big that would want people to come back...|Version 3.3.0|2
copy link?|the update is fine except for the fact that I can't copy the links anymore. I would always do this to send them to people and save the videos. how do you do that now?|Version 3.3.0|3
bad update|the whole sharing thing is really pointless and now I can't revine anything. the posting layout was also way better before|Version 3.3.0|1
Stupid update|You can't copy a URL link anymore to send to some one via text. It's much harder to do that. Private messages? Screw that!|Version 3.3.0|1
The Update|I do triply edits and I just posted a new one with this update and it ruined it the old version before this was perfect and had everything tweaked from the quality and now it's just a huge mess again|Version 3.3.0|1
App not working properly|I don't know what's wrong with the app, I even tried updating it but every time I get a new follower it doesn't show or change the number of followers on my profile, please fix this issue.|Version 3.3.0|3
The recent update doesn't let you copy the link|Now thanks to the recent update, I cannot share vines with people who do not have the app. Before you could copy the link to the vine but now you cannot. I have tried the three dots on the top right hand corner but it does not work for me. Please undo this.|Version 3.3.0|3
Vine|Great App|Version 3.3.0|5
Awesome|Really good app. I think everyone should get this app. It is amazing!|Version 3.3.0|5
Crashing|Could open the app fine yesterday but apparently there was an update and now it crashes every time I try to open it.|Version 3.3.0|1
Plz put it|I like some of the vines and I want to share it on Instagram|Version 3.3.0|4
revine|so I love vine and go on it 24/7 but the latest update makes it really annoying to just quickly revine it and idk if anyone else thinks this but I do. I love the app very much I just don't like the new update.|Version 3.3.0|3
Update|The new update tried to make it more sharing friendly with the videos, but they took out a major part of copying the link which is basically the only way I share funny vines with my friends. Please put it back app is great other wise|Version 3.3.0|1
New update|Hate the new update. It takes longer to just simply revine stuff|Version 3.3.0|1
i cant upload from my camera roll|I tried to upload a vine i made from my camera roll on the latest ios version, and it crashes everytime. I had to download a separate app to upload videos now. thanks vine :/|Version 3.3.0|1
The update is bad|It won't let me copy a link please fix this!|Version 3.3.0|3
I think it's better than Instagram|The app is awesome and better than Instagram|Version 3.3.0|5

Awesome app|Thank you so much for this app it sometimes could kill time thx for the app|Version 3.2.1|5
DO NOT update, I repeat, DO NOT UPDATE!!|This latest update has some changes, though minor, that are very negative.|Version 3.3.0|1
Copy link|Bring copy link back Por favor|Version 3.3.0|4
Bring back copy link|I like the idea that I can Revine and share at the same time but I want to share in IMessage. I used to copy the link and paste it. I don't like that I can do that. I wish I can Revine and copy the link at the same time. That would be perfect.|Version 3.3.0|2
Can't search!|Crappiest search functionality I've ever seen, and I remember using the Internet in the 90's. WHY can we only search for people or tags? And not even two tags at a time. Am I doing it wrong? Are you really that stupid or am I the stupid one? Seems logical that the NAME of the video would be a good thing to be able to search since that's the thing people identify the video with. Guess you guys have never searched for a YouTube video by typing the name of the video. No, you just go and type the name of the user right? And then you just hope they don't have hundreds or thousands of videos that you will have to sort through to find the one you want right?|Version 3.2.1|2
DO NOT GET NEW UPDATE|The new update is the worst update I have ever had on any app. I make edits on vine and now I can not save the audios for my edits and everything is more complicated then it needs to be. Vine please change it back because everyone one I know hates this update|Version 3.3.0|1
Great but here's a idea|I like the app but I was wondering if you can make it to where we can share on Facebook messenger|Version 3.3.0|5

Vine posts|Deasa by post annoying me because they keep popping up on my phone every single second it's annoying I'm really close to deleting this app I used to love it but now all these all these reminders about it it's annoying I'm just going to delete the app okay goodbye.|Version 3.2.1|1
How i lost my Identity|I was a young man at this point in my life. I wore a backwards elmo hat and I sported Gods gift to legs; the affordable, ocean blue rugged Jorts. For those who are heathen it is the Jean Short. I rode my Scooter to school every day. I had girls running from me. They knew what i was, and it was the female self defense mechanism of preventing themselves from falling in love with a playa.|Version 3.2.1|5
This Vine Get Live|This live I can look at this all day|Version 3.2.1|5
Used to be good.|Edit: It's even worse than before. The only good vine channels are gone. Now all I see is loud crowds and 15 year olds saying swag and dancing to awful music. Vine used to be awesome but it's no longer good. There are like 2 viners left that are even worth watching. Went downhill really fast.|Version 3.3.0|1
Great!|Great app for when you need a some quick entertainment|Version 3.2.1|5

Eh....|This app was amazing, but there are some bugs with the messaging, if you put a hashtag in the comments of a post that wasn't recognized it won't show as a really hashtag until the next time you enter the comments of the post, and sometimes a post wouldn't post even with full service bars and the device is connected to wifi...pls fix this|Version 3.2.1|2
I CANT EVEN GET THE APP|So it says I have but its not on my home ....... WHY DO U HATE ME GOD!!!!!!!!!?|Version 3.2.1|1
Awesome app|I really like the idea behind the vine app since you can follow anyone and also get notifications of that person if they post a vine. You can also choose what types of vines you want to see recommended for you, so I think that's pretty cool. Some vines aren't very appropriate for certain audiences, like, kids, little kids, shouldn't use the app. Heck, they shouldn't even know about vine. Vines have certain areas in which they belong, there is comedy, food, cooking, etc.. In general, I believe that this is an amazing app and I think the creators should be proud. Also the people on vine should also feel proud, cause, why not.|Version 3.2.1|5
CHANGE THIS|I CANT BELIEVE YOU CANT UPLOAD HIGH QUALITY VINE LIKE 1080 OR EVEN 720 CHANGE THIS PLEASE|Version 3.2.1|4
Cool|Cool|Version 3.2.1|5

GREAT|JUST DELETE RAPISTS LIKE CURTIS LEPORE AND  MISOGYNISTIC ASSHOLES LIKE NASH GRIER|Version 3.2.1|4
Help|Vine keeps requiring me to put in a verification code then saying the code that I typed in incorrect |Version 3.2.1|2
VINE IS FINE!|What a great app. It's hard to get out there at first but it's still a great app!|Version 3.2.1|5
Sound|For some reason, I don't have sound, when I play a vine it shows the video but the sound does not work!|Version 3.2.1|3
My Likes Won't Load|I "like" videos so I can go back and rewatch them. I've never had a problem with vine until the other day my "Likes" tab suddenly stopped loading videos. Now I can't watch any of my hundreds of liked videos.|Version 3.2.1|1
Two problems|I love the app, but, there's to problems. 1) you should add a edit Channel! It would take all the edits away from the funny vines and into their own place so we're not bothering anyone. 2)IT WONT TAKE COLOURED EMOJIS! Like see come on!|Version 3.2.1|4
Beastmodely|This is some of the most funniest videos I've seen|Version 3.2.1|5
A great app|This was really funny,I had a blast watching these funny mini clips|Version 3.2.1|5
The Vine Message|Vine is an amazing app I have experienced. I use 100x a day. I also make vines myself for comedy. I follow many famous people on Vine, and they follow me back. (Sometimes). But I do have a lot loops and likes for the vines I make. I would rate this app for its advertisement, communication, and occupation.|Version 3.2.1|5
FOLLOW ME / OFFICIALMEGAN|this app is amazing. i love it so much. I've gotten almost 3k in a month from my singing and giveaways! i hate how there's all the spam accounts but overall it is absolutely amazing|Version 3.2.1|5
|I spend to much time on this lol|Version 3.2.1|5
So funny|Vine is such a good tool to get happy on a bad day|Version 3.2.1|5
Ehh|They should give you songs that you could add in! |Version 3.2.1|3
Vine|Love it!!|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|It's an awesome app especially for exposure to other people and being yourself|Version 3.2.1|5
What happened?|I used to like and use the app everyday and I very much enjoy sports so I watched the sports section. Then one day there was an update that changed the entire way new vines were added to the sports section. Now all I see is sponsored with accounts that post non popular videos that do not interest me whatsoever. I believe in my opinion and I'm sure others share this that you should go back to the old way of posting popular videos that people actually want to see. I hope you strongly consider this.|Version 3.2.1|1
You can no longer download an older version.|Now I can't use it anymore.|Version 3.2.1|1
Sports Page|Bring back old sports page it is boring and stupid how it is now|Version 3.2.1|1
Doesn't need internet|Well this is amazing and everything but I don't have internet at home so I won't be able to do much on this app|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine|It is what we make it ;)|Version 3.2.1|5
awesome|this app is great. it's always functioning but rarely it has bugs but they're small for example the vines being frozen on one picture for a while|Version 3.2.1|5
Pretty good|The app itself is great, but I have an idea. Over the past month or 2, I've gained a lot of spam accounts promoting websites, apps, and other stuff. I have also gotten VM's from people to go to a website, or gain followers on vine. If you can delete these people off of vine, that would be great. Thanks!!|Version 3.2.1|4
Awesome App|I love vine!|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|I luv vine so much it's been more than 2 years I've had it now tbh it's the only social media app I have on my phone, but I luv it I can enjoy Amazing 7 sec vids that are creative and most of all funny. If ur debating to download this I recommend u should. I can't remember a Time I haven't laughed at vines people make. Some of my favorite vines are kingbach, jerrypurpdrank, and more|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine is not ok|MY NOTIFICATIONS ARE WRONG PLEASE FIX THEM!|Version 3.2.1|2
one problem...|i really like vine and i do edits:  ahs edits ☠ // but I'll upload my edits and they'll be super good quality. but when i refresh, they'll be blurry and a little pixelized. idk. my revines will appear blurry too and they look like bad quality,  but they aren't in all actuality. please fix this |Version 3.2.1|4
Great but...|I can't put emojis in my username but others can... Why can't I?|Version 3.2.1|4
Awesome|Coolest app on my iPhone|Version 3.2.1|5
Lol|Best app ever|Version 3.2.1|5
Luv this app|I love watching ppl's sense of humor in this app and sharing all of your laughter with ur friends!! It is rlly cool and make more updates!! |Version 3.2.1|5
Extremely buggy!|This version is so buggy that I can't even use it. The app doesn't work on cellular data, only wi-fi. Every single tab says "couldn't load posts" when I try refreshing it either does nothing or crashes the app. Please fix this bug for iOS 8.3|Version 3.2.1|1
I love vine! But major problems.|First of all, I'll start with the bad. The worst thing is THERE ISNT A EDITS CHANNEL! I make edits of my favorite shows and games, but they barely get seen by anyone but my followers. A edits category would be great. Second of all, THE V FOLLOWERS THING IS SOOO ANNOYING! These hackers need to stop and even though you banned a lot of them they're still around. Thirdly, you don't allow any new emojis like this -> they just turn into blAck xs. That annoys me so much. But I love vine SOOO much, don't get me wrong.|Version 3.2.1|4
AMAZING!!|Vine is an amazing app. I personally love vine because there are some pretty funny people on here. 5 stars for an amazing app!! I can't even express how much I love this app!!|Version 3.2.1|5
Great app but one thing ..|It has loads of spam in the comments and it needs to be taken care of|Version 3.2.1|4
Good|It is good and funny|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine is great!|Vine is the BEST!!!love it!!!|Version 3.2.1|5
PLEASE FIX THIS|I've had this app for nearly two years, and I've never had this problem. But in this update, whenever I try to post something the app crashes. When I try to tag somebody , the app crashes. When I try to type a hashtag, the app crashes. I deleted videos, and apps because sometimes if your storage is full, your apps don't work right.|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine|Love it|Version 3.2.1|5
It's alright|It's alright|Version 3.2.1|4
Okay|Vine has gotten worse due to new updates. Vines have been deleted and many accounts have been suspended or deleted. Also a lot of people making vines now are competing and vine isn't fun anymore. Vine also needs to add folders to the dates you have liked or revined to find a certain vine easier. Otherwise vines are fun to watch other than competitions.|Version 3.2.1|3
Really good|Very funny and I love it |Version 3.2.1|4
Love it!|I love this app and everything about it.|Version 3.2.1|5
|Vine helps me with my depression...|Version 3.2.1|5
Please!! Please!!|There are a lot of pages on vine and there are people who like to make edits and they are amazing, I am an editor myself. Please add an edit page. It will be useful because A lot of people on vine make edits. There are thousands of vine editing accs out there. Please consider our request!|Version 3.2.1|5
BAD!!|I downloaded that app and the circle thing went around and the app disappeared. I looked everywhere on my phone and I couldn't find it anywhere. It was weird! I restarted my phone and tried getting it again. It said open so I pressed it. It didn't do anything. I kept trying to get it to appear on my phone. It's been a few days and it's still not there. I'm getting mad because it's taking up space in my phone and I need all of my other apps so I can't do anything about it.|Version 3.2.1|1
Awesome|Really good! I haven't seen any problems though|Version 3.2.1|5
Its a great app but|Video limit is too short we should be able to take longer videos|Version 3.2.1|4
Must register and log in to watch a Vine|Vines don't play in Safari so I bought I'd try the app. The app won't play unless you're logged in. I won't register to watch a single six second video and am not enthused by the incompatibility with iOS Safari.|Version 3.2.1|1
GREAT....but add one thing|I think it would be cool if you could add a favorite feature where people could favorite their favorite vines and they go into a certain folder like how the likes are. it would be so great to have all of my favorite vines in one place.|Version 3.2.1|4
Love et'!|Hey guys I'm new to vine and I find it rather neat and entertaining  If you could support my page @ NickTheGlorious I would love you forever|Version 3.2.1|5
Love it, there's just one problem.|Why can I only hear vines when I have earphones on|Version 3.2.1|3
Vine|Such a funny app|Version 3.2.1|5
Great but add this|You know what you should add? An option to save vines to your camera roll. And something to get rid of Spam|Version 3.2.1|4
Aww yaws|Nice|Version 3.2.1|5
Very Disappointed|This app used to be fun and original you were able to create a 6 second video without any edits but you were able to make something creative. Now you have a bunch of people putting up YouTube videos or putting special effects. The original vine is dead|Version 3.2.1|1
What|I downloaded the app but it isn't on my phone   What happened |Version 3.2.1|1
The app is loading my activity or my profile|I love vine, vine is easily my favorite social media but it is becoming very hard to enjoy when I can't like, revine, or even load my profile. I have the latest update so I don't know what exactly is wrong. Please fix this bug.|Version 3.2.1|3
Won't let me use my number to log in|Okay can I just say this is total bs. The new update requires you to use a email to log in. My vine has 350+ followers and now I can't get on it because it doesn't have an email.|Version 3.2.1|1
One of my favorite apps..…!|I love vine!GET VINE TODAY IT IS SO FUN IT LETS ME REVINE AND LIKE EDITS OF MATTHEW ESPINOSA I AM HIS BIGGEST FAN ANYWAYS IF YOU LIKE TO BE HAPPY GET VINE !   If u want to be in on the new internet hits get vine right now!|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|Awesome it's so cool and the DIYs are the best with a capable B|Version 3.2.1|5
Problems|My vine doesn't work anymore. The profile pics don't even show up|Version 3.2.1|1
Does not work|It will not work on my iPad Air people's profile is white out and can't read messages|Version 3.2.1|1
Great|This app is great|Version 3.2.1|4
Make an editing channel for the edit people|Go follow me on vine at Drexmz Edits#NXEDITS|Version 3.2.1|5
Amazing...obviously.|Been on vine for about a year. Have a nice following or whatever but that's no what I love about it. What I love about it, is that I can creat videos and make people laugh while also watching other people and having them make ME laugh. I mean...it's great.|Version 3.2.1|5
Awesome|It's really cool |Version 3.2.1|5
Great but...|I really think there should be a shuffle button for the pages so you can continue seeing new vines I really love vine but hate scrolling|Version 3.2.1|4
Needs an edit option|I love vine, but one thing I need is  an edit option after we have already uploaded a vine. Like by edit like edit the text. Thanks!|Version 3.2.1|5
Awesome|☺️☺️|Version 3.2.1|5
I downloaded the app but it was not showing on my home screen|I downloaded the app but it was not showing on my home screen Y?|Version 3.2.1|1
SPORTS PAGE|FIX IT!!!|Version 3.2.1|1
Ney|Why is my sound not working? It works for every other app|Version 3.2.1|4
Search tab needed!!|I think that there should be two Columns on your profile . One for your actual videos and another for your actual videos. There should also be a search tab to look for a certain vine.|Version 3.2.1|5
Don't get lazy to read this ∪▽∪|Whenever i get bored it's my num 2. Fun app !  The 1. Is ifunny :)|Version 3.2.1|4
Great app|I've had the app for a while now and laugh really hard all the time thanks to the comedy page! I wanted to start making vines but I tried to upload videos and the app keeps crashing! It's really annoying.|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine!|Amazing app!|Version 3.2.1|5
POPULARITY|Ruined sports page for viners that take time edits.|Version 3.2.1|1
Amazing|idk what to say. I just want it to stop saying rate vine|Version 3.2.1|5
A problem...|I use my iPad to record vines, because my phone isn't an iPhone. So I can't record, because it doesn't let me.|Version 3.2.1|1
I'll|I love this|Version 3.2.1|5
Has it been glitching?|Ok I used to have 230 followers and I followed 3 hundred something people and then I went on the other day and noticed I lost 60 followers and I was only following 2 hundred something people. WHAT HAPPENED???|Version 3.2.1|1
Fun app!|Lots of funny vines that will make you laugh. Vines range from comedy to sports to singing and it has everything for anyone. This is a really good app! |Version 3.2.1|4
No sound|Please update because my sound works on EVERY other app, but won't work on vine. Will change to 5 star.|Version 3.2.1|2
2 things that would make vine even better!!!|Now, I would have given this 5 stars, but I want to see if vine can come up with 2 ideas I think would be awesome! 1. Add more stuff to edit, not just reverse and cut clips. I mean like FX! That would be amazing! 2. You should add, not only a front or back camera, but also a in-phone camera so maybe we can use clips on our phone or use other vines in our video! I think these changes would be great for vine and I hope they get added!|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine App|App is pretty good, but is kind of cringy and annoying.|Version 3.2.1|3
7Crownz|Shout out to everybody @ Vine and the makers of this app. Vine is dope! six seconds is crazy time to be creative & come up with material. I love editing and coming up with something original & funny. I love watching what other top and amazing Vine 'Rz I love this App !! One Love & Peace 7Crownz|Version 3.2.1|5

Problem?|I love the app so much and u can even get the app for your kid(s) it is called vine kids|Version 3.2.1|4
More colors|Add more colors please |Version 3.2.1|5
Vine sports|I am a huge fan of vine but without the popular sports page like it used to be its not as great that people's main concern and I think it would be awesome if we can get the old popular page back⚽️⚾️|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine has gone downhill|I used to love vine because it was so funny but now it's really slacking, it's mostly just a bunch of spam accounts and nobody really posts anymore, it's just gotten old. I usually just watch vine compilations on YouTube now because I don't want to go through all the spam. Please fix this and make the app faster! It's so slow because of the new update. Please fix! |Version 3.2.1|1
Nice but..|Random followers keep following me is there any way to keep my vine private for family and friends :P|Version 3.2.1|4
It's good, ok!!!|Nice app for pass times|Version 3.2.1|5
Awesome|Awesome amazing fun funny|Version 3.2.1|5
Good|Very good app|Version 3.2.1|4
Sports|#?SPORTS PAGE|Version 3.2.1|1
Best app ever|Great app|Version 3.2.1|5
ugh|so, vine deleted off of my phone. it tells me it is installed, but its not on my home screen. idk if it is the app, but i am very unsatisfied without vine. fix it!|Version 3.2.1|1
|I like it|Version 3.2.1|4
I love vine but please change this⬇️⬇️|Don't like the new update for double tap to like because if I wanna pause it, it will just like the video please take it off. Or make a on/off option feature please!!!!!! Also when I post a vine my whole screen turns black? Another thing is I will in revine a lot of stuff and it won't work also it says I have 500 revines and it only shows 4 posts there is a huge bug and glitch on this app please fix it soon, one more thing that bothers me so much is how the vines don't show what year they were posted in. It just shows the month please fix|Version 3.2.1|1
Funning|I think young people can guess how to use this.|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine...|Let's face it. Vine has failed in the big world. Yes I still love vine, and use it very often. But I watch vine for Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Matthew Espinosa, you know the big boys. But ever since they became so popular all they have to do is revine they're old stuff. I'm tired of watching the same thing over and over. Vine shouldn't let you revine your own stuff. Maybe people would stop in undownloading and deleting vine. Take this into consideration please, and bring the old vine back.|Version 3.2.1|3
I just got it but ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|Ok sooo I can't do a lot of vines do I get in trouble if I don't post a lot?|Version 3.2.1|5
Stop|Good app. Please stop popping up every 10 seconds to ask me to rate it|Version 3.2.1|4
Add Edit Channel Pls|Loving vine but one MAJOR problem. Vine needs to have an editing channel. Yes, editing channel. 10,000 people on vine, edit including me. There should be an editing channel where our edits are on there. Yeah the other channels are important too but most of vine is made up of comedy vines and vine editors. There's a channel for comedy, why don't you guys add editing? Editors like myself spend hours to make an edit for our followers and they come out looking great. We need an editing channel for editors. There's not 10 editors, 10,000. There should be an edit channel for those who take their time to edit about our favorite YouTuber, Actress, TV Show, model, Actor, Viner (yes we make edits of viners) and also make edits of other things. Example, there were a LOT of Starbucks edits, Netflix edits, Coke Cola edits that look like they are professional and could be on a TV commercial. So please, it's honestly not that hard to have an update and add an editing channel. This is for me and hundreds+ editors.|Version 3.2.1|4
It's great butttt....|My name is mina did on vine i make funny vids on vine follow me This app is great but there are too many spam accounts and too many adds tiger wise it's awesome|Version 3.2.1|3
I love Vine, but|Sometimes tagging people in vines can really be a struggle! You type in their usernames and they don't show up but... it's still their username and they didn't delete or anything. Please fix this!! My vine is "valkyrie ★彡"|Version 3.2.1|3
I want to be Cameron Dallas|He's so so so so so so so so so so so so so soooooooooooooooooooooooiooooooooooo HOTT|Version 3.2.1|5
Yum|Love it. It's great and entertaining, but you should allow us to send pictures in message|Version 3.2.1|5
Amazing App|It is amazing. I never thought that I would be able make people laugh through the internet. Vine helps me to create videos and show it to others. Follow me Emin Khananayev and I hope you would love it too.|Version 3.2.1|5
Bring back sports|Vine was great until you took away the good sports section now it's just crappy|Version 3.2.1|1
Awesome|Vine is amazing|Version 3.2.1|5
I like it|I like it|Version 3.2.1|5
Highly entertaining|Very fun to see all the videos but I don't think it's very user-friendly, difficult to get the hang of|Version 3.2.1|4
Too many issues|Hey I have a vine called Sports & Music (17K) and I can't seem to follow anyone. Please resolve this issue ASAP because I find it really annoying. Also please bring back the beloved sports page|Version 3.2.1|1
The entertainment|I love it|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|A very good app, yet not as popular as it used to be. Vine, please bring back sports selection!!!|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine|Love it❤️|Version 3.2.1|5
Nasty|So nasty|Version 1.4.8|1
Oldest vines first|I love vine but I wish there was a way to view an account's oldest videos first instead of having to scroll all the way down.|Version 3.2.1|3
Great....but|It's a great app, but I hate how my feed is always filled with spam|Version 3.2.1|3
Really Funny|Supper hilarious|Version 3.2.1|5
It's cool but..|I loveee the app it's just idk what happened I don't know if it's me but the sound doesn't work and it's only in this app!!! My volume works on other apps and stuff but not on this 1 fix it plzzz|Version 3.2.1|5
LOVE THIS APP|I love this app so much, but I have a suggestion. Vine editors are pretty important to vine and are entertaining. I run two vine editing accounts and I suggest there is an editing category for editors! I would rate it five stars if this happens, so Please make this happen! |Version 3.2.1|4
Wats the point tho?!?!?|It's useless unless u have a life that revolves around internet vids #childrenof2day|Version 3.2.1|3
Crashes every time I try to record a video!|Recently the App has began crashing every time I try to create a video.  I hit the camera icon & it goes to a black screen & then the App crashes completely?!?  Is anyone else having this problem?|Version 3.2.1|1
Vine.co|I need vine in my life once a week|Version 3.2.1|5
I love it but...|I really like vine I just wish there was a way for us to save the vines to our camera role|Version 3.2.1|5
Nasty|This app is over flowing with those Nasty twerking and snap stealing apps they are so OMG!! Dude people need privacy. And is there a blocking button? I want to block them so bad|Version 3.2.1|1
Awesome|Great|Version 3.2.1|5
MAKE AN UPDATE!!!|I would love and update to where under the post section on a profile, where it says "show or hide revines," you would have two buttons that says "organize first to last" so that you don't have to keep swiping to get the the first post.|Version 3.2.1|4
Best app|Its the best video app so far ...|Version 3.2.1|5
Cool!|Hilarious!|Version 3.2.1|5
Keel|Ha|Version 3.2.1|5
iPad|You guys should seriously consider making this app for iPad  You guys might make more money|Version 3.2.1|4
Jam/Spam|On my page when I go to like or unlike vids or revine/unrevine the number that shows up on my profile is wrong, and there's soooo many spam accounts. Update and fix these puh lease?|Version 3.2.1|3
Best|Love it|Version 3.2.1|5
Why|It won't open the app it isn't even in as one of my apps and I downloaded it  it makes me sad|Version 3.2.1|1
WHY|I told the app that I didn't want to write a review. Now every time I like a Vine, the app pesters me into writing this review.|Version 3.2.1|1
Weeeaaaaaaak||Version 3.2.1|5
app review|it's a great app. I just wish it had filters for my videos.|Version 3.2.1|4
Bots and spam|The app was great before all these people started spamming my account I simply can't deal with it anymore please fix and then maybe ill consider redownloading. It's a shame because there are multiple people on here that I genuinely like...|Version 3.2.1|1
Why. Why?!|What happened vine? Everywhere I go there's literally a shoutout and a lot of nasty people that should be stopped. There are so many Shoutouts and spams it's annoying. I mean vine is still good and all but well it's changed and it isn't a good change.....|Version 3.2.1|3
Double tap |The double tap to like is so annoying. That only works on pictures, I don't even know why you added that. It's dumb, useless and you need to get rid of it. |Version 3.2.1|1
WANT SPORTS PAGE BACK|Come on vine are you serious? Do you really want bad ratings at least 40% of vine is sport editors and they all want features to be them not teams highlights and practices we've seen it cool cp3 and make a 3 point shot. Want to know what would make it cooler, a beat drop and explosions! Just saying vine help yourselfs out and bring back the sports page!|Version 3.2.1|1
AmAzing app love it.|I just got this app and I already love it great job guys making it.|Version 3.2.1|5
Please bring back the old vine|Now you can't get on any of the categories besides like comedy family and music/dance. It's really hard to get known now because if you make a good related vine it won't get on the page and if you use comedy you need like 1000s of likes to get on it because all big famous  Viners use it. Same with family and music/dance. It's really hard to get noticed now. My vine account is matt and rain btw|Version 3.2.1|2
Upload Failed....AGAIN!|This used to be a great app, but after every update comes the consistent inability to upload. Getting really tired of having to remove the app and add it back again just to get it to work.|Version 3.2.1|2
THIS DOESNT WORK|I like vine and all but ever since the new update they took away sports page!!!!! And plus now whenever I try to upload one of my vine it gets to a sliver of a second and says upload failed. So please fix this, I want the old vine back with sports page.|Version 3.2.1|2
|I got 1k then I accidentally deactivated now all my stuff is gone |Version 3.2.1|2
My Notifications are broke|Hey Vine, so lately as I go into vine. I see that there are no notification on my screen or on my account. This has been happening for a few days now and I am suffering from the glitch. Thanks and hopefully you guys can fix it.|Version 3.2.1|1
It's good but|I like the app but may you allow it so you can but emojis on your name plz|Version 3.2.1|4
Beautiful|Makes me smile every time I get on. I love it |Version 3.2.1|5
This app ALWAYS makes me laugh!|Vine can always make my days. The vine-famous people are hilarious. The trends on Vine are too funny. This VINE app has me DEAD You should download it:)|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|Like the app|Version 3.2.1|4
Here are 2 things I think they should add|1. When you go to someone's profile, there should be a button that you could tap that will show you all the vines that you liked by this person. Gets annoying having to go through all your likes to find ones you liked a long time ago.  2. Have a button on each person's profile that will show you that person's most popular/watched vines.|Version 3.2.1|5
Cool|Cool|Version 3.2.1|4
I like the app but...|This is fun app, but the spam is so overwhelming and vine is deleting accounts that don't use front camera?!?! Seriously I don't understand why your not getting rid of the spammers! Vine stop deleting the accounts that make edits please I beg you!|Version 3.2.1|4
Best Videos ever|Make some pretty nice videos myself. Just look up Deadbeef8 and Like and Follow!|Version 3.2.1|5
Too funny|OMG PPL have to download this app it is. Amazing and the best part is its FREE|Version 3.2.1|5
Great app!!!!|I think vine is a great way to express yourself in your own way and also knowing that there is a lot of people who have vine there is gonna be a bunch of people who like what you do. It is awesome for example I post parkour and free running also trampoline and flip vines if you want to follow me it's freerunning_tramp have fun with vine and good luck revine for follow|Version 3.2.1|5
Great but needs changes|I love this app but it's almost impossible to find vines on it. What a great update would have is something to organize old vines (different personalized boards to revine onto, so that finding old revines would be easier). I hate that I can only like things and revine them onto one page, it makes finding old stuff hard, and makes me less likely to revine/like due to the lack of organization and sheer numbers or my revines.|Version 3.2.1|4
MUST READ!!!!|I just love Vine  it was so awesome amazing great videos it was so funny and too many reminders The sound would not play it was horrible in the updates just got worse and worse then vine was something I didn't even want to go on I would not buy this app|Version 3.2.1|1

I used to love vine until...|I used to go on vine everyday even though there is a lot of spam but, I still love it the, only problem is one day I decided to open the app so I could laugh but when the 7 second videos played I heard no sound, I reset my iPad and turn the volume up and down but nothing worked, I would love to know if you could fix this problem that would be nice and just to let you know I'm using an iPad Air.|Version 3.2.1|2

Fun! Really fun.|This is crack level addictive.|Version 3.2.1|5

I Don't Know If It's me or The Bug|I got on vine this morning and I noticed I lost over 100 followers and I've only posted about two videos everyday it might be that I'm not making good enough vines or there is a bug in the system what's going on here fix it "genius"|Version 3.2.1|3
Hacks!!!|I love this app. I constantly am on it, because I can just hop on, and have a good laugh, y'know? I saw this post though. This post intrigued me, because of the fact that it was giving you followers. Now, almost any viner knows what it feels like to have followers, so they will be enticed into doing it. It take over people's channels. It sends that message to every single friend that the person has, and if you have a lot of friends/subs, then a lot of them will try it! I am sad because they are taking over channels each day. PLEASE STOP THIS MADNESS!!!|Version 3.2.1|4
Good|The only reason I'm doing this is because every time I liked a vine it would tell me to rate and wouldn't go away even if I pressed no thank you. KNOCK IT OFF|Version 3.2.1|3
This app is great.|This app is great but it could be better!!!!|Version 3.2.1|4
mabh_jdeed|ooooookkkkkk|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|Let's face it vine just isn't that great anymore:( why? Vine was originally a source for unlimited imagination and hilarious videos and don't get me wrong some of the day one viners still do that beautifully. However in the past year vine went from funny videos that had never been done before to talented vine stars promoting products . The vines were still great but they managed to sneak in a little ad within it. Then more and more viners began doing this before we knew it it got annoying. I honestly didn't mind at first but then nearly EVERY vine had either an ad or a "go follow my friend bla bla bla " and now vine is riddled with ads and vines that are nothing but ads and fake accounts. Vine used to be so much more popular|Version 3.2.1|4
Amazing but...|I love the app the thing now is that the sports page is ruined it's mainly all sports teams but not like it was before so yeah but other than that love it|Version 3.2.1|4
Vine is good but..|Vine is very addicting and fun to watch and make videos. But the update and some other things made me put it to four stars. It's repetitive videos can sometimes be boring.|Version 3.2.1|4
☁️|☁️|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine sounds?|I've had Vine for a long time but yesterday I was watching and I couldn't hear anything, I thought it was my speakers but I can play my music and etc so I deleted vine and re downloaded and it still is doing the same thing?|Version 3.2.1|3

|Hi LOL|Version 3.2.1|5
God|God|Version 3.2.1|5
Overload of spam.|I seriously love the app. Does it have its issues? Yes, but what app doesn't. The only thing I find almost unbearable is the constant spam in the comments and videos for followers or hacks. If there could be some way to get rid of those that'd be fantastic. I don't know if that's possible though because I'm not a developer... I'm just the consumer. Overall I am happy with the app... It's just the spam that literally makes me want to... Scratch that sometimes throw my phone across the room because that's all I see for a good like 10 minutes because some how it'll manage to make it on to my feed no matter what I do and no matter who I follow and unfollow and block. And yes, I have resorted to blocking people who spam because I'd literally see them 15 times in one scroll down my feed in like an hour for some useless follow spree or something. Anyways, other than that like I said... I am pleased with the app.|Version 3.2.1|4
Awesome|I love it it's hilarious and a great place to be yourself and be funny|Version 3.2.1|5
iPhone 6 plus user|Good app wish that sound would play when phone is in "silent mode" YouTube seems to play alright but vine doesn't for some reason|Version 3.2.1|2
Why? Please fix! Please|I'm new to vine. Kind of but when I got to search, the keyboard never show up, and I cannot write a comment because it like glitches and goes to my feedback section and it might be a problem with my iPod's keyboard but I doubt it. Also I can't do anything in 7 seconds so if you could make it so that they can be at least 15 seconds it would be a lot better! Please and thankyou|Version 3.2.1|4
Sound bug?|The vines don't make any sound|Version 3.2.1|1
|I was just on vine and everytime VINE ALWAYS CRASHES everytime when I try to scroll down it just boots me out the freakin app like plz fix that or 1 rated star will stay 1 rated star forever !

Mahh|BANNERSS!!! PLS BBYs|Version 3.2.1|5
Update|In an update, I'd suggest adding a feature that allows clearing out your activity. Many people tag me saying hurtful things and I can't make them go away, I know I can block the people or delete their comments but it's still in my activity feed. Thank you.|Version 3.2.1|4

BRING BACK THE SPORTS PAGE!|I used to love vine but since the sports page has been tooken down vine has gone downhill|Version 3.2.1|1

Funniest thing Ever!!|Omg, I love everything about this. From friends to comedy. You will laugh your heart out!!p.s. I love Markiplier!!|Version 3.2.1|5
Uhh... U need to fix this|So I have been using vine for a few years. I honestly love it. The updates are tolerable but not the best. U should go back to the original version. U should also do what Instagram did and get rid of all the spam accounts. They're really annoying. The only other thing is that sometimes when I go on vine it will load only a few videos and then I get kicked off. Other times I will go in an account and it will load the noise of a video but won't load the actual page. I try to refresh it and it just kicks me off again. Same with when I go in my profile.  i have checked to see if it is my internet or if it is just my phone. But everything else on my phone works fine and my internet is working fine. It is the app please fix this!|Version 3.2.1|3

Bring back the sports page!|You need to allow all accounts to get access to the different vine categories. (Such as sports) My vine is KYLEHD Sports if you're are interested.|Version 3.2.1|1
Bug with front facing microphone.|Great app but there is a problem with the front facing mic. When toggling between front and back camera, the front and back microphone on iPhone 5s should react the same. They do not, presumably due to the last update. VERY irritating!!|Version 3.2.1|5
Awesome|Rate//1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009000000000000000000|Version 3.2.1|5

Bring back the SPORTS PAGE|I loved vine. Being able to watch 6 seconds of amazing sports plays! Great songs with fantastic beatdrops that fit perfectly with the play. But when vine  absolutely destroyed the sports pop page with unentertaining boring plays only posted by officall hockey football basketball ect teams with no music and beatdrops that fit perfectly with the play... Whats the point anymore. Vine has dramatically decreased since they've removed this. How many people have to beg you to add this back. I am one of the co-owners of insane sports (follow us) and without the sports page, within one week of having our page up we got thousands of loops scatterd across our post and 45 followers. But if the sports page were still around insane sports would of been booming along with hundreds of other sports accounts (examples Relentless sports, 6 second football, best of chel,) please add this in the next update. Were all begging please bring it back.|Version 3.2.1|2
Sports?|I have used vine for a long time. With the update they removed the best part. There are no more dunks. No more ankle breaking jukes and no more bone crushing hits. Not even worth using anymore. Uninstall.|Version 3.2.1|1

horrible|it is acting up making me type in authentifications and saying it is wrong every time and im typing it in exactly as they want. i ready to delete it. it happens if i try liking a vine , sharing it sending it or commenting or typing a vm|Version 3.2.1|1
Large file size|Because every vine I view is cached to my phone, the app gets very large and I have to delete it and re-download. There should be an option to turn off the caching or at least a way to remove the existing cache without deleting the app. Great otherwise.|Version 3.2.1|3
Very good|It is one of the best apps ever|Version 3.2.1|5

Rating worse than 1?|I've been using vine for quite a while now and it's great it really is, but recently vine has been messing with my follower count and has been removing tons of my followers. I was so close to 300 followers and then one morning I go to check on my follower count and I now have 190. If this was fixed I would change the rate to maybe four stars even five, but until this is fixed I'm not rethinking my decision.|Version 3.2.1|1

What happened?|I was on the peak of 250 followers and then overnight (yes overnight) I woke up and my friend said "go look at your followers on vine you only have 178 now" What?

Losing followers|Why the hell am I losing followers|Version 3.2.1|1
Vine|I have to say i love this app!! But there are problems such as hackers..|Version 3.2.1|5
Ideas|I will give it a 4 because it lowers my quality in vines & when I post, you should fix that. And there are other people in vine who post edits and work as hard as the people that make them, vine should create a channel for edits:)|Version 3.2.1|4

Sports Page|WHERE DID THE SPORTS PAGE GO|Version 3.2.1|1
Liking Videos|Before the update you could just press the like button or retweet button. But this new double tap thing trying to make it like Instagram doesn't work.when you try to pause a video and then un pause it it automatically likes it even if u didn't mean to and I only like certain videos I think are hilarious so I can go back and watch them later under my likes on my profile. But this update makes me like every video even when I accidentally hit the screen. It's quite frustrating and annoying|Version 3.2.1|3
Has a few problems, but it's still good.|Though it's a good app overall, you may get many of spam followers who just revine adds. Also, if you make any Vines that are about anime or shows or books (basically a Vine about any "fandom"), Vine may take away your some of your followers. It's happened to me. (The genuine followers are lost, you're still stuck with those spammers.)|Version 3.2.1|3
Losing followers|I'm an editor on vine and I've been doing it for 8 months now. I was so close to 1.8K followers (I had 1,799) then over night my follower rate went down, and now I'm at 1,730 followers.... HELP ME IS IT JUST A GLITCH?|Version 3.2.1|1

I have been using vine daily for almost 2 years. This is ruining vine!!! Please I beg you. Also another thing. I'm trying to vm my friends and almost every time, I try to send a video and I click on the arrow to send it, then it just freezes. This happens a lot in VM's. I have to close out of the app just to make it work and I'm sick of it. One more thing. I'm a baseball editor and you guys want to delete sports editors. Is it wrong to express our love in sports by editing? Social media is being ruined. Stop this please|Version 3.2.1|1

There's a little hack|As in the name. there's a little hack going around and believe me I asked my friends who had vine.As U may know people make websites to give you free followers, There's a website called Vfollowers.net . My friend was trying it out and maybe others but when she was waiting for her offer..she had No followers to come(she refreshed and even waited on till next day) She woke up the next day hoping for her followers but instead had over idk she blabbered about 60 something Messages (Vm's) on vine. She checked all of them and she saw that she sent the website name (Vfollowers.net) to all of the followers that she had.She never did that ever. Also her vine hasn't worked for 1 month now! Please see if anybody else is experiencing this|Version 3.2.1|5
Ehh|Good app but Ive recently been followed by many pornographic and fake accounts|Version 3.2.1|3
PLEASE READ/FIX|I love vine! It's my favorite app. But idk why whenever I go to post or comment it crashes, I've deleted all my pics and apps thinking it was 'low storage' but nope, please fix this cause ppl are starting to unfollow me, another suggestion maybe more colors? Like glitter and textures :) please fix/upgrade of not then I'll have to delete the app cause it's getting very frustrating|Version 3.2.1|4

Sports page|Bring back the sports page|Version 3.2.1|1

Bring back sports page|I'm new to vine and I was gaining followers pretty quickly but now that you guys( Vine ) have gotten rid of the sports page I feel like vine has no purpose for me anymore|Version 3.2.1|1
Good|Muy Buena,y divertida 5 estrellas.|Version 3.2.1|5
Come on vine|I love vine but please Jair for improvements. Can you make it so week can actually download the videos.|Version 3.2.1|4
It's okay.|The thing I really don't like about this app is, every single time I like a video, this little sign pops up saying give us a rate. It gets very annoying at times because, it pops up every time I like something.|Version 3.2.1|2
New Update|Ever since the new update I haven't been able to get any sound from the videos. I don't know if I can do something in the settings or if it's the app. (Yes I made sure my sound was up)|Version 3.2.1|3
Great|Sometimes my sound doesn't work but besides that the app is great |Version 3.2.1|4
Bring back sports page!!!!!!!!!|It's boring without the sports page|Version 3.2.1|1
Vine app|Hasn't been working since last week It doesn't load|Version 3.2.1|3
It is great I really love it|I liked when we could revine things over and over again to keep it k your page you should bring that back even if you pay attention to these I ALSO MISS THE SPORTS PAGE|Version 3.2.1|5
Vine|Great App sometimes it's annoying though to see revines I don't want to see so I wish I could block a page and not see their vines. That's really my only complaint|Version 3.2.1|4
Bring back old Vine|Vine I don't appreciate how you deleted edit accounts. Some of those accounts were my favorite accounts and would always make me laugh if I was sad. You deleted them because of copyright. If it's copyright then people who vine with music in the background should be deleted also. Also, to violate it the song would have to be 30+ seconds. Don't delete accounts if you don't understand the rules...|Version 3.2.1|2
Eh..|Great app and super funny, but one thing is that there are too many advertisements for apps!|Version 3.2.1|4
what happened|vine has been worse throughout the months cause no random accounts are getting suspended for no reason only cussing (which I'm pretty sure is allowed) and the mic on the front facing camera is broken and it's not just mine, my friends complain about it too. please fix vine it was my favorite app and I would love to have it the way it was again :) thank you|Version 3.2.1|2
Great|Fun app|Version 3.2.1|5
