Loving it|So amazing. always love tumblr|Version 4.0.1|5
I heart tumblr|I love tumblr, been using it for several years. I've never been more dedicated to a site, seriously.|Version 4.0.1|5
It works|It does what it is supposed to do. Easy to use interface. No crashes. Blah blah blah.|Version 4.0.1|5
Doesn't work well|When viewing photos or a video it doesn't let you go back to the dashboard. Please fix.|Version 4.0.1|1
It's tumblr|What else is there to say not to much bugs, to the parents "monitoring" and restricting their children's internet this a 17+ app that should tell that it might not be the app for your child's "innocence" to be continued|Version 4.0.1|5
Good But Small Changes Needed|I like the app a lot for its usability, but it's somewhat clunky in appearance. I wish you could set the backgrounds to black instead of navy.|Version 4.0.1|4
:))|Loveee|Version 4.0.1|5
My favorite app|I spend so much time reblogging and blogging I love tumblr|Version 4.0.1|5
It's better|There's the issue of accidentally following blogs. If you could have tumblr ask if we're sure we want to follow the blog before letting us follow, that'd be very useful.  I keep accidentally following blogs.|Version 4.0.1|4
Soooo bad|This is sooo bad I get the app and I can't see or open the app please help signed   HOPFULL PAL|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app|Easy to use|Version 4.0.1|5

Good stuff|Stuff is real good|Version 4.0.1|5
Good vibes|Love the layout and the simplicity of this mobile app version of Tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|5
Updated review|This last update has caused the tumblr app to take up the most room than any other app on my phone. No Bueno!  ⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️ Love tumblr. Always have and (hopefully) always will. The app is great in that it does what a mobile version of tumblr needs to do without bogging itself down with un-necessary bulk. Which keeps it from being a hog of space on my phone. Apps which take up a lot of space will normally get themselves deleted from my phone no matter how much I like them or how much time I waste on them. ✋✌️|Version 4.0.1|1
Love of my life|Fricken bomb!!! This app gets me through school download it its radical|Version 4.0.1|5
Can't post|Ever since updating I cannot post on tumblr. Txt posts, photo posts, etc. tumblr works on my phones browser or my computer but the app is a no .  ITS BEEN A WEEK AND STILL NO UPDATE AND I S CAN'T POST ANYTHING ON MY PHONE  WHY TUMBLR WHY|Version 4.0.1|1
Step it up|I love tumblr. A lot. But I love the website more than this app. The app shuts down and the pictures rarely ever load. Step up your game dude|Version 4.0.1|4
5 star version|great app|Version 4.0.1|5
Nice|Awesome|Version 4.0.1|5
Good|It's a good app I use it all time So 5 star|Version 4.0.1|5
Best blogging app. Ever|Tumblr is hella bomb. I be on here for straight hours|Version 4.0.1|5
Like it but don't like it|So I've had a blog for four years or so and I absolutely love it, but this new update is screwing everything up. The logo is ugly af and I can't seem to work the app anymore, it keeps quitting. Please fix that... Other than that the website is cool|Version 4.0.1|3
Excellent app|It offers great content. I read one review about too many adds. Wow crazy. Not even close its a free app how do you think they keep the lights on? Anyway love the app.|Version 4.0.1|5
Great update!|So when are you guys going to launch another app just for listening to the songs we've posted on our blog? That would be awesome|Version 4.0.1|4
Cool app|It does all the basics from your phone which is nice. There's quite a bit of ads and for some of the better features of Tumblr, you'd need to go on the actual website and browse/post. However, it's still cool.|Version 4.0.1|4
Video loads are slow|Video playback and load time are horrible!|Version 4.0.1|1
Tumble Time|I dig this so much better then Facebook|Version 4.0.1|5
User|Just love this app!!!|Version 4.0.1|5
What happened to the icon?|It really does not look good :-(|Version 4.0.1|2
I absolutely love tumblr|Only thing that it really needs in my opinion, is the ability to add pictures and gifs to reblogs from the camera roll :(|Version 4.0.1|5
IM PHAN TRASH|I LOVE THE APP AND STUFF BUT HELLO IT KEEPS CRASHING EVERYTIME I TRY GOING DOWN THE PHAN TAG AND IM GETTING SAD. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO MY NIGHTLY CHECK ON DAN AND PHIL. PLEASE STOP THE CRASHING IM CRYING|Version 4.0.1|4
Several bugs|1. The new icon is ugly as hell, plz change back to the old one  2. Every other posts' option button is overlaying with the post status number.   3. Every button is displayed in FollowButtonTitle, LikeButton, TagPrefixCharacter etc,  4. And the notifications only display in 2 or 3 letters, which I don't even know what it means.   Plz fix these.|Version 4.0.1|2
Awesome|Gurt|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app tbh .|I don't use the app much but when I do it's gr8 ! I think it should have a totally different look tho , because sometimes I hate how the feed looks and idk , a change could be good please .|Version 4.0.1|5
NEW UPDATE NEEDS FIXING!|So all the other app updates went smoothly for me up until the most recent update. The app won't load most of the pictures on my feed and it's getting annoying. PLEASE FIX|Version 4.0.1|2
Awesome|Got to have App!!!!|Version 4.0.1|5
BEST THING EVER|I love tumblr and idk y evr1 is h8ing the icon lik RLLY|Version 4.0.1|5

Test test test|Never written a review before test test test|Version 4.0.1|1
Love you tumblr|Great app, lousy loading time. Improve those things and I'll be happy. I come to tumblr for the content but if I can't see it because my mobile app won't load it then it doesn't do me any good. Also a read more option and the option to shut off music that's playing or pause it while in the mobile app without having to scroll back up to the post would be great.|Version 4.0.1|5
Pretty good app except|It would be awesome if we could enable notifications only for when we receive mail or our questions are answered. I would really appreciate an easily accessible queue button, maybe next to the reblog button? It does take a awhile to click through the setting and queue a post when trying to queue a large amount. The app is slightly buggy and slow, but overall, it's great.|Version 4.0.1|4
Love It!!!|-I love this app!! I use it on my iPhone && my Kindle Fire HD!. Either way, your able to everything!! Nice!!|Version 4.0.1|5
Well then|Fantastic app all around. Like the ability to make a new blog, but still wish I could change the name on my blogs in the mobile app.|Version 4.0.1|4
Me encanta|En mi iphone5S va perfecta gracias tumblr|Version 4.0.1|5
Awesome|I love Tumblr |Version 4.0.1|5
KEEPS CRASHING|Ever since the recent update, i cant even view my dashboard or anything because it crashes every time.|Version 4.0.1|1
really|great but like get rid of the ads they're unnecessary|Version 4.0.1|3
The app is better|I've gone on the website and it wouldn't let me reblog anything. Now I can actually do that! But it keeps closing while I'm searching things|Version 4.0.1|4
Not happy|Not happy with this new update. Way too slow and now I don't have the ability to copy and paste text. Not good|Version 4.0.1|2
|Use app daily and love it.|Version 4.0.1|5
Dope|Dope|Version 4.0.1|4
Dope|Dope|Version 4.0.1|5
Yes|I do|Version 4.0.1|5
Loading Time|I love all of the changes to the app -- yes, the icon is okay -- but one of the main problems I have with the app is that everything seems to take a lot longer to load. I've resorted to opening up tumblr on my browser because that's the only way I can see any content. Shouldn't the app be more optimized to run better? I give this a low rating because without seeing any content, how can I enjoy using the app?|Version 4.0.1|2
Bc obsessed|Absolutely in love with finding inspiration to life on here. Great app for all men and women.|Version 4.0.1|5
It's okay|It keeps freezing and then exiting. It's completely annoying and sometimes I lose what I was looking at and that frustrates me.|Version 3.4.3|1
Good|Im in love with this app|Version 4.0.1|5
Images crashes|i dont know if is my wifi (i rlly dont think so) but so many images most of the time didnt load.. they stay in blank and this come after the new update, plis fix that is annoying cant see all the images|Version 4.0.1|3
Stop making updates. Just stop.|You have a great app here. But shifting around the content of the site and changing the logo does NOT make it better in any way, shape, or form. The specific complaint I have is whenever I attempt to edit posts I have made/reblogged, the app completely quits, and I'm brought back to my refreshed dashboard. I have to log onto my laptop, and edit the post from there.|Version 4.0.1|3
New logo|I hate the new logo that came with the latest update. It stands out from all of the other apps on my phone, and not in a good way.|Version 4.0.1|2
Won't stop crashing!|Seriously guys. It was fine before, now ever since the update it crashes as soon as it's open. So annoying.|Version 4.0.1|1
Bugs! A lot of them!|I’m using tumblr a lot. I discovered a mine of gold for sharing my experiences. I love the platform. But the app is coming with a lot of bugs.. Correct them please!|Version 4.0.1|3
app review, NOT community review|I'm only going to talk about the app itself, not the other users (as that's a can of worms I don't want to open up). as a mobile app, it works fantastic depending on your internet connection. it doesn't have as good an interface as the browser version but that's true for all social networking ports. it functions, it does all the basic functions, and except for the occasional update that COMPLETELY WRECKS THE APP (as in, 4-21 early morning -.- ) it works like a dream. if you have a tumblr, this app is mandatory.|Version 4.0|4
|The app seems better the website|Version 4.0.1|5
Tumblah|The app loads slow pretty often, but it's tumblr so.|Version 4.0.1|4
Hey! Saltytreebeard, here.|This review does not contain subliminal messages. (follow me)  Anyhow, I mostly visit Tumblr on my desktop computer, but from my personal experience with the app (follow me) I have nothing to complain about. Keep up the good work. You're fantastic.  Love always,  Saltytreebeard.  A.K.A... I follow back ;)|Version 4.0.1|5
Funny|Follow funny ppl.|Version 4.0.1|3
Anyone want to suggest a new blogging platform to me?|Dash never loads, and when it does, it's slow as hell. Can't post at all on mobile. Quickly losing interest in Tumblr all together.|Version 4.0.1|1
Still great|That's all|Version 4.0.1|5
Blocking feature|Tumblr is great and all but I think it would be better if there was a blocking feature instead of an ignored user option. The blocking feature can allow us to block someone from viewing our blog and refollowing. The feature shouldn't be shown in the account settings.|Version 4.0.1|4
Tumblr tumblr tumblr|I actually really enjoy this app, and by that I mean I enjoy wasting my days away glued to my phone screen while obsessively reblogging almost everything I see. However, I really wish I had the option to post gifs/photos on texts posts or just posts gifs in general because gifs are really just how I communicate over a screen. Also, everything seems to load a bit slower than it used to and that is rather annoying. I would greatly appreciate these changes along with the reduction of ads because there is just far too many ads and not enough gifs (in my opinion).|Version 4.0.1|3
awesome sauce|i didn't even use my iPhone before tumblr|Version 4.0.1|5
Text selection become difficult in the last update|1-Text selection become difficult in the last update  You should try many times till its works!!  2- the icon is not better than before (my opinion)  3- the app become a little bit slower than before.|Version 4.0.1|2
Tumblr|Ok app, need to censor better, too much inappropriate on site|Version 4.0.1|3
||Version 4.0.1|5
IT WONT WORK WITHOUT WIFI|PLEASE FIX THIS ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE THIS ISSUE I CANT GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT MY BLOG PLEASE FIX|Version 4.0.1|2
HEY NOW HEY NOW THIS IS not WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF|As you can tell by my title I have some concerns. And by that I mean I have a comment of something you should try for Tumblr. You guys should totally make a button where all of your (your account) blogs are. Not blogs you re-blogged, but ones you created. Instead of having to search all through your page. And if there is such a thing already then I'm a clueless son of a gun. Thx boi  Your homie, Britt|Version 4.0.1|4
|Love it..please don't make it turn into a Facebook or Instagram..pretty please!..|Version 4.0.1|5
Videos|Videos are super buggy and never load.|Version 4.0.1|1
Home|I love tumblr so much. The updates keep getting better an better.|Version 4.0.1|5
What an amazing app|The app is amazing!! the only problem is there when you are at others tumblrs there is no button for ask or anything like this.|Version 4.0.1|4
I love tumblr but some glitches|Would be great if it actually loaded the pictures. Don't update the version then have it work less than before.|Version 4.0.1|1
Love it|I like it , it's fun|Version 4.0.1|5
My app is gone|The app just deleted from my phone. I did a hard restart on it multiple times and it won't come back. I checked my App Store and it said its still in my phone and when I do a search, it pulls the app up but takes me to the Internet or to the App Store. I don't know if this is my phone being dumb or a bug in the app. I love tumblr and have had it for about 3 years now, this has never happened before.|Version 4.0.1|1
Annoying|Tumblr has by far the slowest video player on any app I've used, and each gif takes minutes to load, no exaggeration.  Also this app has the most MB than any other app on my phone, and it really doesn't make sense because I don't have any posts or reblogs, and I only follow 3 people. For whatever reason that it takes up so much space, fix it. I don't want to delete the app every time I need space on my phone. It really isn't worth it for the app to be half of a GB! Thanks.|Version 4.0.1|3
Great app!|Enjoy the flow of the app. Very user friendly.|Version 4.0.1|5
Best app|I love this app and it's definitely my most used app on my phone|Version 4.0.1|5
Expressive|It's the perfect medium for self expression!|Version 4.0.1|4
Keeps Crashing|With longer gif posts  Also can't email anyone.  Please fix!  iPhone 6 Plus - iOS 8.2(12D508)|Version 4.0.1|1
Tumblr|Tumblr ruined my life bet made it better somehow -revivingpeeta|Version 4.0.1|5
yeAH|There could be a few improvements but all around great app|Version 4.0.1|4
love it!! just a suggestion.|I really like the app, it's one of my favorites. the only thing that I would say they need to add is the ability to post audio from mobile. that would be wonderful!|Version 4.0.1|5
Changed my life|When I first heard the name tumblr I thought nothing but a land of hate and femnazis. After downloading this I have realized my true calling in life! I have arrived at a conclusion that my true sexual identity is a pansexual transgender pony. I am now a faithfully converted feminist. Set out to destroy cis gender freaks because they are more comfortable with themselves than I Am. For all people are not created equal. Only the minority can be equal. White men rich or not are all rapist and meninist pigs who deserve no less than hate. This app saved my life. Opened my eyes to the new world order, and gathered my strength to preach the commandments of out female muti-gendered and multi-sexual God.|Version 4.0.1|5
Missing the basics|Until this app allows you to add tags when replying to asks or add photos to text posts, it's almost insulting to provide updates where the logo is the biggest change. I have to wait to reply to asks when I'm near a desktop so I can properly tag it, which is something I come across almost daily. So at least once a day the app is useless to me...|Version 4.0.1|2
Tumblr app|Wishing I could access password protected blogs on the mobile app.  Overall the app is improving but still needs some work here and there, keep at it!|Version 4.0.1|3
|Every time I try to open the app it crashes|Version 4.0.1|1
Works like it should|What you'd expect|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app!|. Much fun. Very App.|Version 4.0.1|5
Great|I like the retry server button, that was necessary. Still great, no crashing or anything unless it's actually too much for the app or phone to handle. One recommendation though is to add a rejection button or left-swipe for blog suggestions so I don't see the same old blogs again and again. Maybe put 'smash cache' one tap closer (I don't have a ton of memory and I gotta go back and forth to it a lot) I also like how you can identify a loading gif vs a still image. Keep up the good work, the app just seems to be getting better.|Version 4.0.1|4
Really?|I can't even stay on the app for five minutes without it locking up everything. I have to restart my iPod every time.|Version 4.0.1|2
Great app|Tumblr on my iPad.  What a joy!|Version 4.0.1|5
you can watch NSFW Content|SWAG just keep loooking and youll find it|Version 4.0.1|5
Welp|Writing a review because they asked. It's Tumblr, what more could I ask for? Thank you Devs|Version 3.8.3|5
Ya|Yeah|Version 4.0.1|5
Pleaseee fixxxx!| For the past month or two everytime I open the app it crashes within a few seconds... I tried deleting the app & then reinstalling it and now I can't even sign in from the app since it closes everytime I hit 'Log In'... Then I even tried going outside the app and using Safari and it still keeps crashing  sooooo frustrating! Normally I wouldn't even complain since most bugs are fixed quickly but I can't deal.. Might have to find a new fav app if this keeps happening |Version 4.0.1|1
Freezes phone & uses up phone memory|Freezes my phone after 5-10 min if use every time. Then a hard reset is the only way to get my phone back. Such a memory hog. Don't even use it every day and it's up to 3 GB! So I cannot take photos or download more apps until I delete Tumblr. Deleting forever is the best thing you can do and just go to tumblr.com in Safari.|Version 4.0.1|2
Cannot perform basic tasks|"Wanna reblog? How about we just log you out"-tumblr app|Version 4.0.1|1
Going downhill fast|Staff needs to get their priorities straight before xkit guy makes his own blog site and everyone leaves to there. Nothing loads it glitches people are rude but I have it because I like it enough I guess? I used the site way more until I got mobile version.|Version 4.0.1|2
You've got bugs|What's wrong with all the "buttontittle"?|Version 4.0.1|3
LOVE IT minus the shutdowns|This app is typically my second home. Sometimes when watching videos it can glitch up and shut down. Other than that it's amazing.|Version 4.0.1|4
:-)|WHO DOESNT LOVE TUMBLR???? tumblr is amazing!|Version 4.0.1|5
Bugs|Music won't play or load, videos get stuck in full screen, app design is 3D and ugly.|Version 4.0.1|2
!!!|Love!!!!!|Version 4.0.1|5
Bugs as far as the eye can see|Where do I even start? Even when I'm on a strong wifi signal images wont load. The app crashes randomly for no reason. Just touching a video to scroll past it crashes the app. Follower count randomly jumps around. Sometimes I can't see the text on something someone reblogged. My activity bar is slowly vanishing every day until i have no recent activity showing. I really love Tumblr but all the bugs on mobile and even on the desktop are making the site almost unusable. Try actually fixing the bugs instead of changing the icon.|Version 4.0.1|2
Nice App.|Thanks for creating.|Version 4.0.1|5
Nice when it works*|*UPDATE: it STILL FREEZES tumblr staff! Will you fix this?! – – – Functional interface but with no rhyme or reason, it will just freeze. Rebooting does nothing; I have to delete the app then re-install it. And with the latest version, no more editing. Not to mention the inability to reblog an item unless I just leave it be w/o adding commentary.  It's quite a skill to take a buggy piece of software and then make it WORSE! Initially, 4 stars... now it's just two (only b/c I can still OCCASIONALLY browse). Would you fix it for f^ck sake!?|Version 4.0.1|2
Yes|I love tumblr. Too much. A lot. It's great.|Version 4.0.1|5
Wonderful|I love tumblr. It has all the new fashion tests and cool pics|Version 4.0.1|4
I love tumblr in general but fix the app!|Won't reload unless I close out completed and open it back up, not as fast as it used to be. I hope there's an update soon that fixes all of this.|Version 4.0.1|2
Great app!|I mean, if ur addicted like me then this is just a way easier way to use the website :)|Version 4.0.1|5
Pls add tags to mobile theme!!!!|Many people use mobile theme and there is no way to message/look at tags or anything. Pls help with that. Xx|Version 4.0.1|4

So frustrating|Doesn't load any pictures, ever. All I see on my dash are Vine videos and text posts.|Version 4.0.1|1
YAS|Yes|Version 4.0.1|5
At work|I don't have many problems with the app, but it would be really great if it had a NSFW filter that you could turn on just when you're at work. Can't control what the peeps I follow post but it would be nice to have a little bit of a safety buffer zone.|Version 4.0.1|4
It's pretty good|If you like memes and misleading audio posts|Version 4.0.1|5

Keeps crashing|The app has suddenly started crashing when I try to launch it, it goes to the login screen and then kicks me back out to the home screen on my iPad. Literally started happening out of nowhere, and now I can only launch the app if I delete and download it again.|Version 4.0.1|1
Beautiful|While I'm not a big fan of the site itself, there's no denying this is a beautifully designed app, it's gorgeous UI alone just left me wanting to stay and browse the app, it's interactive and aesthetically pleasing experience was nothing short of breathtaking. Marvelous job, wish all social media apps had the special touch this one has!|Version 4.0.1|5

ugh ugh ugh|I love tumblr, I have for 3 years now . Its become my escape. Since the update , photos, gifs, videos are taking sooooo long to play sometimes up to 10 minutes in full wifi connection. My blogs has also been messing up. My post or reblogs are not showing up sometimes and it's very frustrating . I'll sign out , back in . Even reset my wifi to see if that was the problem . and nooopppeee . I will be looking for a update .|Version 4.0.1|2
You need to fix this...pronto|This mobile app is too slow and it takes a long time for basically everything that's not a text post to load. I like to scroll along my dashboard or certain tags in the morning while I'm on the bus and I keep having to close and reopen my app  because it takes forever to load. Please fix this.|Version 4.0.1|2

I CANT POST ANYTHING AFTER THIS NEW UPDATE|I still can't post anything up after this new update!!!|Version 4.0.1|1
Great app|Tumblr has made this app incredibly easy to navigate and handle, being a person who uses my phone more than computer, it's super refreshing knowing I'm not missing anything from the Tumblr desktop version to the phone version. Keep up the great work! Highly recommend.|Version 4.0.1|5
I love it!|I love this app, but it is extremely hard to get followers and likes.|Version 4.0.1|4
It works.|So what if people are racist? Is it against the law? No. Shut up.  ----------------------------Does what I want and I've had no problems. Thanks tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|5

It crashes every time I try to open it.|Ever since the update I haven't been able to use it because it won't open.|Version 4.0|1
Love it, BUT!|I love tumblr with all of my heart, but this update isn't all that great. Content seems to be loading SO much slower & I'm not liking the new logo. I would like it to be as it was. Waiting for my dash to load is aggravating & half my dash is advertising anyways. It would be nice if it at least advertised things we like, maybe by putting a survey to see what we're interested in & only advertise things in those categories. I would also love to see tumblr make queuing faster & easier so I can queue as fast as I can reblog on the app. I'm on this app/website basically everyday & I would love if things were faster & easier for us who are on the go. Please make these changes!|Version 4.0.1|3
Great app|I love all the recent changes but it would be cool if you could get a better blocking system so that by blocking someone they can't view your blog. Also a chat feature would be nice to make talking to people easier. Thanks a lot staff.|Version 4.0.1|5

New Update....|I love tumblr, tumblr is life. I dunno how I feel about the new update, I haven't used it much since it updated earlier today. But from other people's reviews, it's like being hit by a bus full of adorable babies and puppies. Exactly. Also, the new icon is cute but I liked the one we had originally.|Version 4.0.1|4
Good, but meh|I mean like its hella worth it but the pictures and videos take up so much data and they don't even load|Version 4.0.1|5
Tumblr|Love the luxury of being able to view the many spectacular varieties to browse from! The app is easy to use, and most of all the experience when scrolling down on the feed is really enjoyable. Great Job!|Version 4.0.1|4
Tumblr is life☺️|Best app ever|Version 4.0.1|5
App no longer works|I have no idea why, but the app has disappeared off my phone, even in my settings. So naturally I went to go redownload it, and all it says is "open", and when I click it, it doesn't open. Super annoying.|Version 4.0.1|2
I like tumblr but...|You lost zh-hant/zh-hans (may more?) string file in new version.|Version 4.0.1|3
Tumblr|I love tumblr, and I really have no problems with the new update except that it's cheesy. The old icon looked waaaay better and the widget is a useless battery drainer. Maybe if it was more applicable to specific blogs ?  Other than that. Love me some tumblr|Version 4.0.1|4
I love tumblr., but I am frustrated|I can't search for ANYTHING. The app literally closes out. It is also telling me that I have two messages, but I don't. I have reinstalled the app three times.|Version 4.0.1|3
Tumblr Is My Life |best app ever ! idk what i would do without it tbh |Version 4.0.1|5
FanPhuckintastic|good stuff.  don't get addicted to this thing like Facebook.  screw it. you will.  have a nice one.|Version 4.0.1|5
Please add this to computer version|I love how you can go to someone's blog and click the tags to see it on their blog. Maybe try to add that to computer versions?|Version 4.0.1|3
Amazing|I absolutely love this app|Version 4.0.1|5
Awful|The app harassed me to review it when I was just looking something up on a friend's account. I don't even have an account I use. Tumblr is the worst.|Version 4.0.1|1
UGH!!!!!|This is so stupid!  I got the app an I tried to sign up but it won't let me! It's so annoying! Plz try and fix that cuz I've been trying to make an account allllll day and it won't let me!!!!  Bottom line, this is really annoying and I think that I'm just gonna delete tho and get Twitter or something instead|Version 4.0.1|1
Me gusta mucho|Not bad for on the go. Works fine for when i don't feel like getting the laptop out of my bag. We'll see I guess.|Version 4.0.1|4
.|I find Tumblr helpful for when I don't want to pull out Google, but I rated it 4 stars as it is a bit confusing.|Version 4.0.1|4
It is a tad bit laggy but lol works|Pretty good app|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app|Good alternative from the other social media|Version 4.0.1|4

Great app|Great app for writers and bloggers alike|Version 4.0.1|5
says I have a message but I don't?|when I click on my blog, it says that I have a message. so I click on my messages and I have nothing there. I deleted & reinstalled the app to see if it was a glitch or something but it's still there. please fix it! otherwise, tumblr is my favorite app by far also you should tell us when we hit post limit. its annoying to reblog a bunch of posts and then you look at your blog and realizing none of them got posted due to the limit. thanks|Version 4.0.1|4
WHY ?!!!|Okay so, I don't know if it's just my app or the new update but Tumblr keeps crashing. I try to search something or look at the trends but once I go on that specific thing it crashes. I don't know what to do honestly. I've emailed them about it but nothing is helping. Tumblr, you really need to get your things together.|Version 4.0.1|3
Exceeded limit|The only complaint is that it doesn't tell you when you hit your daily limit!!! This seriously needs to be added to the app|Version 4.0.1|3
Yay!|It works.|Version 4.0.1|5
amazing|this is really good app|Version 4.0.1|5
Fantastic app|I love it|Version 4.0.1|5
Love it||Version 4.0.1|5
Too much memory|I love this app till the death, however, it takes up wayyyyyyyyyy too much space on my phone... Is this something perhaps Tumblr could fix? They need to have a better mobile platform.|Version 4.0.1|5
Fix needed|Any time I open the search the app crashes.|Version 4.0.1|1
Love|In love|Version 4.0.1|5
It's Tumblr|It's great. I love it! Things can always get better but I wouldn't mind it if it stayed this way forever |Version 4.0.1|5

LOVE IT|I LOOOOVE TUMBLR|Version 4.0.1|5
Love the app but..|I'm always on tumblr nearly everyday  But honestly the mobile app needs improvement. I can't reposition my avatar? I can't even see my face and it's bothering me because I don't want to edit or format my picture, I just want to reposition it.|Version 4.0.1|4
Good|One of the best apps yet|Version 4.0.1|4
Icon is terrible|I don't know who decided to change the icon, but it's really ugly. The app is okay. Lots of ads, but it does the job. Bring back the old icon, please.|Version 4.0.1|3
The quintessential, unifying blogging app of our time|Decades from now, historians will look back on our time—here, now—to discover why and how we finally achieved world peace.   Their conclusion will be irrefutably unanimous: Tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|5
|It's legit the best Social Network |Version 4.0.1|5
Fun|Fun tumblr is fun|Version 4.0.1|4
How much I love Tumblr|I love Tumblr I get to meet my BFF there and I'm really thankful for that. Thanks so much Tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|5
Can you fix the real problems?|Tumblr, you need to check yourself before you reck yourself. Strike that, you are recking. Hard. Seriously, what the freak is going on with your new logo? Did your child design it?   Also the adds are crazy annoying (and have been triggering people, not cool). I realize that's how you make money, buts it's too much.   There are still so many real things we need: Gifs working properly, being able to post pictures in texts posts through mobile, and being able to have a better blocking system.|Version 4.0.1|3
Queef|Words cannot express...|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app, could be better|I've had a blog for 4 years and Tumblr has definitely come a long way. But they only give us half of what we ask for every update, the rest is stuff we don't need. It seems when Staff asks us what changes we want to see they ignore us and delete blogs/tags with no warning. My biggest complaint is definitely the new logo, the old one was perfectly fine. We still need a better block feature, there's way too many ads cluttering the dash, and gifs & videos still take forever to load. That being said I'm on this stupid app everyday & I'm not going anywhere tbh i love it.|Version 4.0.1|4
Fantastic|I love it!|Version 4.0.1|5
|Awesome ❤️|Version 4.0.1|5

Eh|Every time I try to search for something on mobile the app crashes no matter how many times I try|Version 4.0.1|5

Love this app so freakin much|I'm addicted is meh world|Version 4.0.1|5
Ridiculous new icon|...new icon is unnecessary. If it ain't broke. Otherwise I like the app.|Version 4.0.1|4
Great|I like the app but it's taking me a while to get the hand of how it works.. |Version 4.0.1|4
impressive|it is not the actual interface that is impressive, but the fact that they managed to out-do themselves in terms of having what is the opposite of a navigable interface. a one star is too much for this app. it is the computerized equivalent of stubbing your toe, and then subsequently cutting it off.|Version 4.0.1|1
Killlakillryukoanime|This app is such an awesome app that it can set the whole internet on fire|Version 4.0.1|5
Tum|I love it|Version 4.0.1|5
Shouldn't have updated...|Change the app icon back to the way it was. I don't like the way it looks now, and the app itself is way slower.|Version 4.0.1|2
It's a happy place|Tumblr is a happy place where the things you love are accepted |Version 4.0.1|5
Genial, animo  , !!|La idea y el concepto esta genial,pudiendo mejorar en los dispositivos móviles para estar a la altura de la web, buen trabajo , gracias, |Version 4.0.1|3
I love Tumblr but it won't work|THIS NEW UPDATE CAUSES TUMBLR NOT TO OPEN!!!!!|Version 4.0|1
Why Tumblr?|I love Tumblr but the bugs are killing me. After being on Tumblr for maybe 5 mins it automatically logs me out and starts freezing up. Please fix it, Tumblr is my life.|Version 4.0.1|2
The BEST|Get it and love it. Enough said. It has memes and horoscopes and photos and stories. What else could you want?!|Version 4.0.1|5

Struggling|It's a bit frustrating, the more simple they make it the more you struggle to get what you want to get done!|Version 4.0.1|4
Great app|I really like this app. Haven't found any issues, so I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to start a blog|Version 4.0.1|5
No. Not at all.|As soon as I updated it, it logged me out then it said I can't get back into it. I love tumblr but it's being really uncooperative with me and as I see by the other reviews, it's not cooperating with them either. Please just email me or something on a way to get back in. Thank you.|Version 4.0.1|1
UPDATE 4/19/2015|I haven't been tumbling lately as I've been away from home. I know that's probably the best time to blog, but I'm a little preoccupied. In any event, the latest version, at least on my 6+, is having troubles with pictures. I tap a photo to zoom in, then try to swipe it away. No luck, I have to force quit the app to get out. I'd like to know if others are having the same issue.I'm 120 seconds in and I can't tell you how exceptional this is. I was using Tumblita which is a great app, but this is... Is... (Tears of joy)...|Version 4.0.1|5
New Content Scrolls Current View|Here's what happens to me in this app all the time: I am scrolling through my dashboard; I stop scrolling to look at something; when something — an image, a video, I don't know what as I've scrolled past it — finally loads, it pushes my current view of the dashboard out of view. So, I cannot effectively view the content I want to because things I've scrolled past are now loading. This has made the app so unpleasant to use that I'm pretty much scrapping it at this point. This problem has gotten worse in the latest build, but has existed for some time.|Version 4.0.1|2
It got better|It's better than before  I hope you keep up the good work.|Version 4.0.1|5
love tumblr sm|like best social media ever |Version 4.0.1|5

Muskrat Disses Tumblr App|Stick to the computer version of Tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|1
*speechless*|Have you ever just wanted to escape the real world, but analyze it through pictures at the same time? That's Tumblr. It's an artistic space that not only grasps the beauty of mankind, art and nature, but also has touched of the real world that make you sit back and analyze the society that we live in and what others go through. But be warned, this site will indeed change your life.|Version 4.0.1|5
BEST APP EVER MADE!!!!!|I spend all day on this app wherever I go. Wether I'm in my bed or at the supermarket, I'm always on tumblr. I love this app so much that words can't describe it. I don't know what I'd do without it..|Version 4.0.1|5
Slower, Uglier, and More Ads!|Welcome to the Tumblr app, slower than everyone in my math and that's saying something. There's ads everywhere and sure, I get you have to make money somehow but it's obnoxious! Some of them are NSFW too! I USE YOUR APP IN PUBLIC! I don't want to get in trouble or have someone think I'm looking up porn! Seriously, Staff, who is in charge of your updates? I want to be able to change how many posts I want to post in my Queue but I have to go on Safari then to your website to do it?? Can you do something about that? Also I don't think anyone cares about that trending thing you did.|Version 4.0.1|2
Please!!!!please pleased lease|Can you please let us change our url and let us delete a blog thanks please also there's not a number appearing next to the app when I get a notification can you please change that thanks|Version 4.0.1|5

Cool|I firs dint get it but now I do love it tho|Version 4.0.1|4
Wowza|I like tumblr but you made it ugly and ad infested. Please fire your entire graphic design team and hire the person who made that "graphic design is my passion" meme because they apparently have more talent then your entire design department.|Version 4.0.1|2

CAN'T EVEN LOG IN! |For the past month or two I can't even log in to my own tumblr , on the app or on my computer , when I try to open it on the app it just crashes and same thing online! I'm getting so tired of this please fix it !!!|Version 4.0.1|1
Finally!!!|After struggling a while because I couldn't download the app...don't ask me why, I finally got it and what can I say Tumblr is life and amazing and I'm glad it's back into my life. So |Version 4.0.1|5
Fix this annoying bug!!!! Plzzz|I still have this annoying bug that it shows me i have a message but when i open it, it is empty no message! And it won't go away that annoying message sign. Plzzz fix it|Version 4.0.1|3
What's wrong with you, Tumblr?|All of the bugs, the distorted icons, what's wrong with all the "titles"? What the hell is happening with the new version? You better give some better improvements quickly!!!|Version 4.0.1|1
Too many crashes|This app is crashing one too many times on my iphone 6, please fix.|Version 4.0.1|2
I'm disgusted|The app murders my soul.|Version 4.0.1|1
It's great, but..|Whenever I try to post something on a new blog I create, it posts it to my main blog. Is there any way I could possibly fix this?|Version 4.0.1|4

Follow my new tumblr|I love ittt! Its like all my favorite social medias combined!|Version 4.0.1|5
What Tumblr needs|I really wish Tumblr had options for when we visit someone's blog, we can choose to I hide the reblogs so we can see their original posts and creativity. That would be so legit, no lie. I do love Tumblr though.|Version 4.0.1|4
Why so slow?|Since the 4.0 (aka new ugly icon update), my dashboard won't load properly. The icons from the tumblers that I'm following and their posts won't load. And the few images that do load, takes a long time to do it. Tried reseting the cache and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists.|Version 4.0.1|1
I love it!|Tumblr is life!|Version 4.0.1|5
Bugs bugs bugs|Ever since updating to the new version, I can no longer open the app. Crashes instantly. Have closed app. Have deleted app. Have power cycled phone. Nothing works. Why does a company release a patch without testing it????????|Version 4.0|1

Change the icon back. It was classy.|Usually I have this app on my home screen but because of the ugly new icon I've had to put it in a folder. Don't add shadows. That's the whole iOS 7 theme... No shadows.|Version 4.0.1|1
Awesome|This is awesome and pretty and everyone is smart to post pretty things.|Version 4.0.1|5
nice|a good app for a great site|Version 4.0.1|5
ITS A TRAP|however, this is one of my favorite traps of all time. Once you start you can't stop. You have been warned.|Version 4.0.1|5
Eh|Tumblrs seems to spend like half their time doing anything that their users would find usable but probably because they know we're going to take whatever garbage app they feed us.  Fix the unloaded image nonsense, reblog long text posts AS LONG TEXT POSTS, otherwise the app gets the job done.  And as idealistic as it may be PLEASE GET RID IF ALL THE SPONSORED POSTS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BURN ALL THE ADS.|Version 4.0.1|2
Ran out of storage |I had to delete this app because it took up so much space on my phone...|Version 4.0.1|2
Pretty awesome|Love the app|Version 4.0.1|5
Just y|Ya|Version 4.0.1|5
Cheeseburger fingers|Love it❤️|Version 4.0.1|5
Storage hog|I've had to delete this app 3 times now--for good this time--because it was ballooning up taking up more than 1.5 gig. There's no way to dump the cache either. On top of that the ads are very obnoxious now; every third post is 'sponsored' and there's a permanent text ad at the top.|Version 4.0.1|1
Loading|After some time, picture posts don't load. They are just blank on my dashboard and even on people's blogs|Version 4.0.1|2
Tumblr is live tumblr is life|This is the single greatest invention in the history of mankind. Just please don't tell my mom about my blog.|Version 4.0.1|5

The most confusing conversation threads I've ever seen...|...not to mention posted content vanishing into thin air and attempts to edit drafts exposing markup tags.   BTW, the logo change is tasteless and uninspired.  New management?|Version 4.0.1|2
I ❤️ Tumblr|My favorite app !|Version 4.0.1|5
Tumblr|Post to your blog often. Very hard to scroll to the bottom when you have 500+ likes!|Version 4.0.1|4
Tumblr is awesome|That is all|Version 4.0.1|5
Beautiful animation gone|The animation where the icons would "float up" after clicking "nevermind" has disappeared. They now go back down like a drawer. This fills me with sorrow; that little touch used to bring me so much joy.|Version 4.0.1|1
Fix the Bugs|When scrolling in the newest version the app skips or scrolls the other direction making it impossible to use.|Version 4.0.1|2
|Awesome|Version 4.0.1|5
Decent, but needs improvement.|Consistent crashes, horrible loading times, gifs & videos are rarely viewable.  Tumblr: The app of pitfalls.|Version 4.0.1|3

i hate this website|@staff pls stop|Version 4.0.1|1

First Time|Well, this is my first official use of Tumblr, so I couldn't really give you things I would like to have changed. But the overall setup is nice. |Version 4.0.1|3
Really?|I'm sure that this new update would be great if it would even open. Every time I open it, it just shuts off|Version 4.0.1|1
Almost Perfect|This app is ALMOST PERFECT except for a one reason:  1. It keeps crashing and when you re open the app, you have to re find what you were looking at.  But other than that, it's amazing. Tumblr has everything. I use it mostly for fandoms ( Pretty Little Liars, Supernatural, Percy Jackson, etc.,). It is really fun to use. I would definitely recommend this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Version 4.0.1|4
Havent been able to log|I haven't been able to log on for like 5 updates now.. It just crashes as soon ad i hit log in|Version 4.0.1|1
Too much ads!|The ads are becoming a problem, at first I thought it was like a 1 or 2 time thing but it's all the time and it's very annoying. Also, it would be nice to have a section to see if someone unfollowed you..other than that the app is great.|Version 4.0.1|4

So confused.|Ok. So I made a tumblr maybe two yrs. ago or so and I hated, but I recently made a new one and I love how easy it is to use now. Buuuuuuttttt I'm still confused on how u search for ppl. It doesn't make any sense to me. Is the mobile version different from the full version? And if so why? Ppl use phones for everything now a days so why wouldn't u make the mobile version the same? Just a thought, but other then that. I'm really liking it so far.|Version 4.0.1|3
I love this app.|This such an amazing app. I use the website right now as a personal blog, but now I am writing on my iPhone because of this app. If you like to write and don't want to see useless status or advertising then this is the app for you!! :)|Version 4.0.1|5

Story time: (this is real) Once upon a day ago, late at night, I was downloading the Tumblr app. Today, the App Store says it downloaded, but I can't locate it on my screen at all. When I pull down, my search bar shows up. I search tumblr and nothing pops up except an email. This is a major problem. Fix it please.|Version 4.0.1|1

I have extremely amazing Internet and even at full bars of my wifi the videos I want to watch won't load. This is absolutely ridiculous and makes me not ever want to use tumblr because I can't enjoy it without having to wait a million years to see something I want to watch.|Version 4.0.1|1

I'd rate the app 5 starts because that's how much I love it but the fact that is one of the slowest apps w/ many problems, I'll give 4 starts!|Version 4.0.1|4

Crash|It keeps crashing and I need to always re-open my account. You need to work and improve this|Version 4.0.1|2
Added option|Would be full five stars if it was made possible to reply to a comment on a post, right now to comment back or reply to some ones comment, you have to re-post... After several repostings... It's gets annoying  And being able to tag the person you respond to also...|Version 4.0.1|4
The app has gone downhill|The most recent update ( April 2015 ) is not good. The search section was fine the way it was and now you don't get good search results. Random things come up that have nothing to do with the tag or subject you are searching. The adds are offputting and with all the restrictions you struggle to find anything new. It's all the same stuff recycled.  I've been a tumblr user for years and still enjoy most of it but I can honestly say it doesn't get better- the quality actually is declining; especially on the app.  Seems that Yahoo is ruining it perhaps.|Version 4.0.1|3
LOVE IT|Absolutely love the new update ! Great job|Version 4.0.1|5
It cool|Hi|Version 4.0.1|5
Good And Bad|I do like a few things about the new version– especially being able to create blogs. However, I seem to have come across a major bug. Images, seemingly random ones from higher on my dash, keep showing up lower on the dash, covering other posts. I can't tap on these images, and I haven't found a way to make them disappear.|Version 4.0.1|3
You can be free here|Tumblr doesn't have the restrictions the other sites have. Let's keep it that way!|Version 4.0.1|5
Seriously|The app was absolutely fine and then now I open it and bam it crashes. I can't do a single thing because the instant I open it it crashes. Please fix this now because I won't be able to go on tumblr otherwise!|Version 4.0.1|1
Major Issue|It will let me reblog other posts but i can't make a post on my own, including texts, pictures, videos etc. Can you please fix this?? i love Tumblr but its extremely inconvienent i cant make a post.|Version 4.0.1|3
Data problem|Had to delete this and reinstall because it was somehow using over 1GB of data. It's not properly clearing its cache and there's no way to force it without uninstalling.|Version 4.0.1|2
Dear Tumblr|I love you.|Version 4.0.1|5
I love it|Great app really beautiful|Version 4.0|5
"Bug" fix|This last update took away the filter options for your search which what was my favorite new addition to the initial update. Wish I never updated.|Version 4.0.1|1
|I'm loving the new updates so much y'all are getting better keep up the work|Version 4.0.1|4
Crash|Since the new update, the app keeps crashing ! It's really annoying scrolling and then crashing . Please hurry and fix|Version 4.0.1|1
Fix the Logo...|The new logo is terrible. It no longer blends with the "flat" feeling of the rest of my icons! I don't think I have ever cared so much about a logo but ever since the first time I saw it, it has bothered me. It just doesn't fit on iOS8! Please change it to be "flat" again!|Version 4.0.1|1
Great app!!|If you like ducks, this app will make your buns hurt (:|Version 4.0.1|5
This app is great. I just have one problem|If I use it a bunch it starts taking up so much memory. In about two weeks the app has taken about three gigs. If you could fix it would be great|Version 4.0.1|5
Love|Perfect app :)|Version 4.0.1|5
Bleh|It's so commercialized now. Ads on ads and it makes me ill. Yahoo is truly destroying this app. The best thing about this app is the content that the ppl create and that's about it.|Version 4.0.1|2
Tumblr Mobile App|This app is a disaster; if previous to this update almost anything loaded, now nothing loads at all: images, gifs and videos won't load. This problem has been present for a long time, and in most cases it's forgiven, but now it's just unbearable, not even profile icons load. The only reason why I'm still using this app, is because it's somewhat better than the web version, but apart from that, it's just plain terrible. There's so much to improve: load times, spontaneous crashes and freezes, the video loading times, and the list goes on, but what matters is that this app is far from being good; it's an unfinished project, like if it were on alpha or beta state.  If you aren't desperate to use Tumblr, then don't download this app.|Version 4.0.1|1
Tumble Love|Love love love|Version 4.0.1|5
The real freedom of speech.|Thank You|Version 3.8.3|5
 ALERT! BEST APP EVER! |Honestly, I use this app wherever I go. Tumblr is my life.|Version 4.0.1|5
getting lost|love how they now offer new blogs to discover based on your preference of other blogs. A little slow on gif loading but good.|Version 4.0.1|3
Tumblr is love, Tumblr is life.|Love tumblr.|Version 4.0.1|5
Great|Nice|Version 4.0.1|5
Fan|tastic|Version 4.0.1|5
almost perfect|It is a really fun app, needs a little bit of a beginner's tutorial, and bug fixing, but I love this app!|Version 4.0.1|4
Idk if it's just me but|I have perfectly good internet on my iPhone, but for some reason none of the pictures or the GIFS are loading. I have already uninstalled the app and reinstalled it but the same thing keeps happening.|Version 4.0.1|5
Best App|I get my fix of everything I'm into from Tumblr.  Comic book art, classic cinema pics etc.   The app is great. The new feature of bringing u to the top and back to ur reading spot by hitting the home screen is perfect. Faster loading.|Version 4.0.1|5
Update crashes!|The last update has glitches! The app freezes constantly! Fix it again!|Version 4.0.1|2
Just cause its life|I love it .|Version 4.0.1|4
Tumblr|It's a pretty good app once you get the hang of it|Version 4.0.1|4
I love you|I'll always give you five stars. even if you screw up. like you still deserve five stars.  u even deserve five stars when u tells us what's new in updates. they're so cute. you're so cute.  I love u, tumblr :-)|Version 4.0.1|5
Great app!|Ads are lame though.|Version 4.0.1|5
A|Aa|Version 4.0.1|5
Like it ......but|I love the update but every time I go to look up someone blog the app just closes it self|Version 4.0.1|2
Would like to add one thing|Why did you change the icon? Keep it simple. Don't mess with a good thing. Although, I do love Tumblr..But I would like to ask for one thing. When the iPad is in horizontal position, could the sidebar be the same as the vertical position? That's all I ask for. Please and thank you. |Version 4.0.1|4
A great app and site.|For the iPad, a fantastic app, and I'd call Tumblr the Facebook for the informed and intellectual. Get this one, pronto.|Version 4.0.1|5
Save your self|The memes. Their everywhere. Run. rUN.|Version 4.0.1|5
Amazing|This app is the best|Version 4.0.1|5
...|The ads are annoying.|Version 4.0.1|3
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!|I've been using this app forever now but ever since the update, the app ALWAYS crashes every time I click on it!! I'm really disappointed because I love this app so much... |Version 4.0.1|2
Ah|Just reviewed this so it stops asking me to review it 5 out of 5|Version 4.0.1|5
!!!!!|Whenever I start to search something it closes out of the app and it keeps on doing that fix it I don't deserve this okay|Version 4.0.1|3
Is cool|Nice could've been better|Version 4.0.1|3
I Love Tumblr|This Site Is NOT for the "normal" *shivers*  people ... I love this site I love the people .. this place is where we try to  achieve equality and we have like everything you could ever think of and if we don't then the world is just not ready for your search .... This site is for the people with really twisted senses of humor , but will defend you to the bitter end if you've made their friendship , Tumblr is the home of the forever alone people, The people who binge watch entire series of TV shows because they like the psychological torture that the end of a season brings ... We have our own sort of language , and we are alll ..., ALL GAY , at least a tiny bit ... anyway the website is great, but the mobile app needs some improvement, or rather to stop changing... thats why I cannot give a perfect 5/5|Version 4.0.1|4
Bug|It have a problem, it trow me out of the app when I try to do a collaboration :/|Version 4.0.1|1
Decent w/ Way Too Many Ads|When I first got Tumblr, I knew I was only going to use it for whenever I got bored. And that still stands today. But when I updated the app and searched something up I was face to face with dozens upon dozens of advertisements. I would scroll down and see even more of them. The amount of ads are ridiculous. I also don't like the new icon for the app either. Overall, I have no inherent issues with crashing with the app and I still enjoy using it. But I'd like to see fewer advertisements in the next update.|Version 4.0.1|3
Love the update but....|It's a great update. Like I love it. Except I don't understand the create a new blog addition. It's great and all. But shouldn't the new blog be a separate blog, instead of a two in one. Because it's very confusing when I want people to follow my new blog and they are instead following my first blog. So just make them two separate blogs. Their own followers and their own people they're following|Version 4.0.1|4
That's What's Ip!|I don't waste my time using emoticons, and I usually don't give five stars. I'm not doing either. So, let's cut to the chase. This app is amazing. Customize your blogs, post comic pages, superb photos and more and more. I rate this 4.5 because of these features, but do your best to put in more effort with updates.|Version 4.0.1|5
Great|Just started, awesome so far. No issues.|Version 4.0.1|4
Love the app but block system needs changes|I really love the app but I think you guys need a better block system (I.e. The user you block can not follow you-- automatically unfollow when you block a person)|Version 4.0.1|5
Random loud audio after phone calls|Recently I have had major problems with this app. It has started playing random bits of audio after I talk to  someone. Yesterday, I was talking to my mom and when I hung up, a distorted version of "Darude" by Sandstorm started blaring from my phone. I recognized it from an audio post I had seen on my dash at least 5 hours earlier. I could not pause it or play music over it. I had to delete this app for it to stop. It played on a loop for about 10 minutes. About 20 minutes ago the same thing happened but this time it was a commercial for an IT college.|Version 4.0.1|1
cool|yeah cool|Version 4.0.1|5
awesome app, bad update|i love tumblr. and i'm glad for the new update, i really am. i mean, i can make multiple blogs in one account and you can put widgets about what's trending on tumblr . but they're some things that they stuff that they need to fix.  1. the gifs take a really long time to load-.they're not smooth at all  2. when i edit my blog appearance, i save it and it never changes. it still keeps on having the same appearance i had before i made the changes (i'm not good at explaining)  3. the tumblr icon is horrible- i'm sad to say that, but it's true.  i love the app, i really do. i love to go to it when i'm bored or need a good laugh. this is just things that i'll like to change. |Version 4.0.1|4
Beautiful|The new update is phenomenal, a great improvement, aesthetically at least. I am anxious to see how performance is with this update. Cheers!  Mar '13 Update: the new UI improvements are even better. Tumblr is on it with their new app! Thank you!!  Apr '15 Update: battery hog? Tumblr drains my battery pretty quickly after update. I have tried not to use the app because of this to save on battery life. Kind of a disappointment.|Version 4.0.1|3
Great App|Love this app|Version 4.0.1|5
Change The Widget|have been a fan and user of the app i just have one issue with this current update, i role play a lot on tumblr and i love role playing a lot on there and i think for the app it would be better to see like my activity feed in the widget instead of the trending cuz i could honestly care less about whats trending, just a suggestion from a developer to another maybe give people the option of choosing if they want to see whats trending or if they want to see their activity feed(s) instead.|Version 4.0.1|5
Some weird new glitch|In the inbox you used to be able to click on the icon of the person who sent you an ask/fan mail and it'd bring you to their blog but now it doesn't and it's extremely annoying|Version 4.0.1|3
Gifs|I love tumblr and the app is pretty good but the gifs don't load on mobile.|Version 4.0.1|4
216|Tumblr is the best❤️❤️❤️|Version 4.0.1|5
Thanks!|Url hoarding made easy!|Version 4.0.1|5
So easy|It's easy to reblog to separate blogs, and it looks great.|Version 4.0.1|5
Anonymous|I really don't like the new icon:( but I do like that I can actually edit my posts.|Version 4.0.1|4
Yep|All I can say is fandoms and textposts|Version 4.0.1|5
Tumblr is bæ|I love this app! With every update it gets better and better by adding new features that just make it amazing. Thank u staff :3|Version 4.0.1|5
Awesome|It was very awesome I love this App|Version 4.0.1|5
Constant Crashes|I can't scroll for longer than literally 2 minutes without the whole app crashing. Thanks, tumblr. You really fixed the bugs.|Version 4.0.1|1
Hvvvvpppppp|Glitchy, slow, eats up your data.|Version 4.0.1|2
Great job.|I find it so easy to use this app. It loads quickly, and has never crashed on me. I highly recommend it because it helps make Tumblr more fun.  I find that I post more often now, because the app is so handy and quick.|Version 4.0.1|5
Stop thinking and just get it already|This app is a great way to have a laugh. Love it!|Version 4.0.1|5
perfect|yass|Version 4.0.1|5
Wonderful!|The new app works super great and much faster loading!  Love the new icon also!!!|Version 4.0.1|5
Great|One of my most used apps. Both a great all and great service.|Version 4.0.1|5
Mobile is getting better|When I first installed the app it was terrible. It limited me in so many ways unlike the full computer version. Then given a few years and the right bug fixes those limitations have gone down. Plus the page does not jump as much as it used to. Thumbs up Tumblr makers you do us proud|Version 4.0.1|5
Still crashing|Keeps crashing when i try to look at someone's blog or post that needs to be expanded. Even some of my saved searches aren't there anymore.|Version 4.0.1|3
|Images from previous posts keep reappearing in my dash and it blocks the content. The app crashes way too much. The app moves everything on its own and I basically just lose control of the app. When I click on an image, the app freezes and I can't get out of the image, which makes me have to restart the application. When I'm scrolling throught posts on my blog, older posts keeping reappearing at the bottom when I refresh. And to top it all off, the new Tumblr icon is horrendous. Please fix these problems.|Version 4.0.1|1
Not suitable for iPhone 4 >:(|My iPhone is an iPhone 4 16 gig and in downloaded the app a few minutes ago, I sign up, I want to look up a tag (or whatever they're called) and I search 'backgrounds' and I hit it "I know I hit it because it turned grey, and it just sits there for a minute then application crashes. I guess I have to do this on my iPad. I do not recommend anyone with an iPhone 4 to use this app.   SQUASH THE BUGS!!|Version 4.0.1|1
A1|Good stuff|Version 4.0.1|5
Wish I could un-update!|Want more ads in your Tumblr? Get the new update! Sheesh, talk about regret...|Version 4.0.1|1
Not impressed|I can't do anything on the app that it offers without my phone completely closing out of the app. I can't delete my posts, change my blog color, anything without the app closing out. It's ridiculous and makes me wonder if it's even worth having the app. I love tumblr, but why would I want something that doesn't work?|Version 4.0.1|1
Cool|Nice|Version 4.0.1|4
Since it crashes so much now .  . .|How about at least logging the last blog post you were viewing or posting and being taken back to that spot when the app gets started again. These last few updates have been horrendous.  Or perhaps fixing that thing when the app pulls a Lufthansa and crashes. What? Too soon?|Version 4.0.1|1
Great app|Great app.|Version 4.0.1|5
||Version 4.0.1|5
Pretty solid app|Good for extra work on images from virgin capture using the phone camera.|Version 4.0.1|4
Terrible design|Repulsive eye sore of an icon. Forced ads. Reduction in usability.|Version 4.0.1|1
SLOW!!!|The load times are ridiculously SLOW!!! |Version 4.0.1|1
Tumblr|Let yourself submerge into creativity with a tool that opens the world through your very own window.|Version 4.0.1|5
greatest update|I love this update|Version 4.0.1|5
BACK TO LOVING THE APP|Thanks for fixin the editing button again !!!! BUT CHANGE THE ICON BACK TO NORMAL|Version 4.0.1|5
Amazing|Addicted, love Tumblr|Version 4.0.1|5
LOVE IT!!!!!!|Tumblr is the best thing I ever used for a long time... Keep it up and don't mess it up! |Version 4.0.1|5
Call the exterminator - you've got bugs!|The version has arrived and is full of bugs. The once solid 't' graphic has been eaten away to just a shell, which adequately reflects the problems laying inside when you open the app.   Besides the annoying advert that gets stuck at the top of he screen, the most obvious and annoying bug that has infested Tumblr is the slow down of how content is loaded.  Remember dial-up internet? Maybe you read about it in your history books? Well it's back thanks to Tumblr.  Streaming videos and pictures load at incredibly slow speeds and, just like dial-up, right before you get to see the whole thing, the app crashes and you are left with no option but to restart and go on a search for the illusive content.  Don't get me wrong, I still love Tumblr and would even wear a t-shirt that says so ( hint, hint) but there is definitely room for improvement. Until the next update, I'll keep my Xanax handy to calm my nerves as I revisit the early-days of the Internet.|Version 4.0.1|2
Amazing|I love this app it helps me vent|Version 4.0.1|5
Good|App|Version 4.0.1|5
Too many misandrists.|The app works fine but it is full of man haters.|Version 4.0.1|2
Ehh|Read updates and wasn't set on the update.   But then you had me at faster gifs.|Version 3.8.3|1
I'm so sad|Love the app with all my respect but CAN'T copied the text |Version 4.0.1|1
Messages 3, No Messages|Keeps saying I have messages when I don't. Weird. Load time isn't really a problem for me on wifi. A lot better than before. Keep up the good work, tumblr!|Version 4.0.1|4
awesome|it needs to stop crashing|Version 4.0.1|5
The icon is horrendous|Change it|Version 4.0.1|1
Icon.|the icon is so ugly. too flashy.|Version 4.0.1|1
Ok, but still needs work.|They are heading in the right direction with updates, but there are still basic features missing that the desktop version offers.   Being able to ignore users and access more functions of queued posts would be nice.|Version 4.0.1|3
Icon|Your app icon is ugly! Ruins the flow of my home screen |Version 4.0.1|1
My rate|Really fun I'm sure everyone has heard of tumbler. Love it your allowed to be you :3|Version 4.0|5
Best app to look at artwork|One of my favorite apps to look at artwork and post pictures of fignutens|Version 4.0.1|5
tumblr app is awesome, but|bring back icon please! new one not pretty at all, just ugly new icon ruined my home screen anyways thank you for work|Version 4.0.1|3
Yo|Love tumblr, app is slow and annoying.|Version 4.0.1|3
never again|everything loads super slow, there are constant crashes, and frankly that new logo is terrible in appearance. perhaps more thought should have went into how the app could run better rather than worry about an icon.|Version 4.0.1|1
Awesome|I love tumblr because it's so freaking awesome. yeah I got several blogs and I think it's cool how you can stay connected with everyone and everything. Not to mention learn brand new stuff from people on tumblr so yeah and I'm the first comment if the day so whoop whoop but the app looks ridiculous I'll admit that and there are some key features I miss using the old version|Version 4.0.1|4
What's with the word art icon?|Everything is fine. Except that new icon. Dislike.|Version 4.0.1|4
The new icon ....|Please change the icon back this new one just looks weird and awkward.|Version 4.0.1|4
please stop|there's another update every time I login and it's never anything that we actually need.   I can't login to my account now, it doesn't say that the email and/or password is wrong, it just won't let me login.   the app takes really long to load videos/pictures and there's still a lot of features that you don't have on mobile like tagging ask.|Version 4.0.1|3
Fan fiction ruins it all|This is actually a fun app, but I'm hoping that if I give them a low enough score, they'll finally do something about the role playing nonsense on the site. I'm not saying stop it, but there really should be some kind of on/off option to see any posts tagged "rp". Very few people actually care about those.|Version 4.0.1|1
Needs old icon back|New one looks ridiculous|Version 4.0.1|4
Hate the ads and yahoo|Get rid of the ads :) No one cares and it isn't the place for it|Version 4.0|2
Rename blogs!|I wish you could rename your preexisting blogs.|Version 4.0.1|5
Addictive app|Love it!|Version 4.0.1|5
Ads, can we say too many ADS?!?!|I like the Tumblr app, I really do!  Even when I've been scrolling and looking at stuff for a good 30 minutes and the app decides to shut down and I go to open it and it starts right back at the freaking beginning!!!! But I digress, my big complaint is on all the ads that now show up, and it's not a variety of ads but the same dang one time after time!    Do you know the word redundant? How about some more redundant? I have a bit of redundant here, would you like some redundant?  How about this type of redundant?  No ? Then maybe this redundant? Maybe some redundant on your redundant and a little more redundant on top of all that redundant!|Version 4.0.1|3
even worse|new logo is EMBARRASSING. atrocious|Version 4.0.1|1
T|WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE 't'  BESIDES THAT THIS APP IS AMAZE BALLS !! |Version 4.0.1|4
Good|I like the app. Simple and user friendly.|Version 4.0.1|5
New Icon|New icon is ugly. Does not feel good under my finger. Change it back. Keep it simple.|Version 4.0.1|1
I like the secondary blog idea|I like the idea, but I can't seem to post from my secondary blog. It seems that the 2 blogs are connected and that's not what I want. Anytime I try to post, it only allows me to do so from my first blog. Needs fixing.|Version 4.0.1|2
Please fix mail notifications|I hate not being notified if I sent someone a question and they answered it. Make it so it tell me wether or not I used anonymous.|Version 4.0.1|2
Tumblr|Love it|Version 4.0.1|5
Bypass of Internet Restrictions|I set up restrictions to ensure no adult content is able to be accessed through any internet browser via iPhone settings. I understand that there will be some blogs on tumblr that may bypass that due to unusual circumstances and the actual restrictions on the settings themselves. As such, certain blogs I've come across that do, I add to prevent unwanted content to be displayed directly to the always block list.  However this only works on mainstream browsers. This app for whatever reason bypasses all restrictions set altogether. Perhaps some kind of fix would be needed to help parents monitor and control the pornographic blogs that bypass the phone browsing restrictions through the app? Thanks!|Version 4.0.1|4
Glitch|Anytime I try to search up blogs or tags in the app it crashes before I can even type anything. Not sure if this is just me or??? And it still happens after I reinstalled the app. Idk but I don't like it.|Version 4.0.1|4
The New Icon Is Ugly|iOS uses a flat design, but the Tumblr team decided to depart from that. The new icon is simply ugly. If they wanted to draw more attention to the app on iOS devices, congratulations, they succeeded. If they wanted to make users cringe every time they see it, they succeeded at that too.|Version 4.0.1|2
Woo|It's nice|Version 4.0.1|5
Great but...|I am having trouble switching accounts when asking something on someone's blog and it'd be great if you fixed it! I'll give 4 or 5 stars when you fix! ♡ ◝(⁰▿⁰)◜|Version 4.0.1|3
Slight improvement|Glad to finally see submission compatability, however videos including vines are incredibly slow to load and the new icon is beyond terrible. Don't get me started on the sticky Nike ad. Honestly i would be willing to pay for an ad-free version for as much as I use this app (assuming the video issues are fixed).|Version 4.0.1|3
Needs work still...|Add a symbol to indicate GIFs or make it tap-to-play. I sometimes find myself staring at a pic that has a lightened effect waiting for it to start moving and it never does. Full settings in-app would be nice too. Timestamps on posts or in notes would be too. Takes forever to load. Videos basically never load. New logo is not pleasing to the eye|Version 4.0.1|1
really?|tumblr changes their layouts like I change profile pics. instead, I suggest they try to actually fix coding issues. I've seen the picture of polar bears in a snow storm trying to take a family photo one too many times for me to approve of this app.|Version 4.0.1|3
Rating|Only four stars cause I can't live inside of this app. Absolutely wonderful app and update is pretty legit as well! DOPE!|Version 4.0.1|4
Tumblr is da bes |no complaints other than I would like to get notifications when I have a new message! thanks (:|Version 4.0.1|5
Pretty good!|So a friend of mine somehow got me addicted to tumblr again (guess you could call it a "good problem") And the app is best way for me to use it. It's pretty easy to use and nothing is much of a hassle on it. All I hope is that most of these new bugs that showed up are cleared because the other reviews are complaining about them.|Version 4.0.1|4
Giving up|This is the third update and still nothing has been fixed|Version 4.0.1|1
That logo is off-putting|I have never felt such a physical response to a logo. It's so off-putting that I actually second guessed using the app. I've been tempted to delete it just so I don't have to stare at that awful logo. It looks so cheap. I hate that shadow effect. Keep it simple, please. As for the app itself, it's definitely an improvement from the last update.|Version 4.0.1|3
Great app!|Good to see what interests people|Version 4.0.1|5
Hmm|It keeps crashing :(|Version 4.0.1|2
Ok, but|I'm not really feeling the new logo. I also kinda hoped that we would be able to post images to a text post and adjust queue settings from the app by now. But, the adding/deleting blogs from the app is cool.. search bar is also pretty cool.|Version 4.0.1|2
Too slow|Hey guys! All the feature's pretty cool but the app it self is slow. I couldnt even load my feed! Or search for tags at all! Please fix this!!!|Version 4.0.1|3
THE ICON FRUSTRUATES ME|The icon was sooo much better before i swear yall better change it back or sum, but i mean tumblr still pretty great|Version 4.0.1|4
Crashes|Every time I try to log on it crashes.|Version 4.0.1|1
PLEASE FIX YOUR APP|I'm getting so aggravated with the tumblr Mobil app. Every time I update it, there's a new glitch. Now it's taking one gif and every time you scroll the gif is on top of the other posts. FIX THIS APP PLEASEEE|Version 4.0.1|1
Horrible New Update|I used to think this app was great, now it's unusable for me. Crashes every two seconds, won't load anything even if signal is good/wifi is connected, horrible icon, overall this has become a horrible app! Very disappointed.|Version 4.0.1|1
Lol at the new icon|That thing is terrible! Tumblr is impossibly slow on iPhone. Puke! I feel like I am trapped in some MySpace like alternate Tumblr world. Get some new gear under the hood and speed this thing up. Whoever is in charge of these sorts of things should be fired. That is no lie. Your number one top priority should be to fix your mobile app. Honestly, if the majority of your traffic isn't coming from mobile, it's probably because your app is so bad that people have found alternatives while they are on their phones. Anyway, terrible icon and slow, same as it always is, junked up Tumblr app. I just gave up. Too much of a hassle. I'm on Tumblr to consume, not twirl my thumbs while I wait for a gif to load. Vomit!|Version 4.0.1|2
bans|cute|Version 4.0.1|5
Fix it!|It takes a long time loading and now it's crashing...so when I try to search things it crashes. I closed the app and restarted my phone & it still doesn't work.|Version 4.0.1|1

This new update is ridiculous|I love tumblr! Its amazing. But>>>>>all their old ways changed. THE ICON ISNT THE SAME. Whateven? Keep the original tumblr logo please.|Version 4.0.1|2
you keep 'fixing' the wrong things|okay, I love tumblr -- don't get me wrong. but, these new updates are just making the app harder and harder to use. the design is terrible. it's not functional. I can barely get it to work. photos and gifs don't load. the app refreshes randomly every now and again, forcing me to lose my spot. it's complicated to queue things and do all the other things tumblr has to offer.  here's something you might consider adding to tumblr altogether: A FULLY FUNCTIONING MESSAGING/CHAT SYSTEM. the ask/fanmail  feature is okay, but not sufficient to communicate with followers easily.|Version 4.0|1
New User|It's fine for now. Haven't used enough to decide what I like and dislike. |Version 4.0.1|3
Good app||Version 4.0.1|4
Newbie|I'm new to tumblr and it's okay so far|Version 4.0.1|4
Great but could be better|The app would be A LOT better if you could customize it like you can on the computer from your app, change password and url from app, block people from app, etc. Just make the app the same way it is on the computer for crying out loud! It's so stupid that you can do those those one the app. We've been waiting for that update forever!!|Version 4.0.1|4
?|I don't get why people are giving 2 or even 1 star, this app is freaking amazing, Although the new logo is sorta wierd, but that's the least of my concerns, even though the gifs don't load sometimes, it's working perfectly fine. BTW  Don't complain  Craft BTW I had to do that I'm sorry|Version 4.0.1|4
I love tumblr but there's a problem|Please let me be able to listen to music while I blog again! Every time I open the app it turns off my music.  Even when I start playing music while in the app it gets turned off while I'm scrolling through my dashboard.  Also, the update made it a little bit glitchy.  Still love you though. xx|Version 4.0.1|3
great app|great app with great team stuff , they care about every single user|Version 4.0.1|5
Good|I love it cause I love fashion and Coler and it is fun and can chat with buddy's lol any ways it think the app is 4 stars|Version 4.0.1|4
|Still can't even likes even after contacting support.|Version 4.0.1|1
Rarely write reviews but...|I love the new update ! The GIFs load way faster and I love how you can create a new blog within the app. I just don't know how to delete them? I don't really like the new icon though. Looks kinda childish if you ask me but other than that this app is perfect! Great job Tumblr Staff!|Version 4.0.1|5
It won't let me post texts or quotes|Cmon...|Version 4.0.1|2
Why do I still have this app?  It only frustrates me.   I use the web page.|The app has limits on posting that the web page doesn't.  The big one for me is that any post is either text, photo, video, etc. but no ability to do a text posting with photos embedded.     On the web version, I can write and on any new line add a photo.    Why has that feature never been added to the app?     Also if I look at a web page for information while writing a post, the app will reload when I come back to it, dumping all progress.|Version 4.0.1|2
Update for the right reasons|The app would be A LOT better if you could customize it like you can on the computer from your app, change password and url from app, block people from app, etc. Just make the app the same way it is on the computer for crying out loud! It's so stupid that you can do those those one the app. We've been waiting for that update forever!!|Version 4.0.1|4

Not bad|It's decently accessible for mobile apps. It is confusing at times.|Version 4.0.1|3
Good job|It works and is efficient. A perfect port of a great app|Version 4.0|5
I WANT THE OLD APP ICON BACK|I hated when I was on the website and the icon changed and now it's on the app too, I know it'll probably never happen but I really hate this icon please change it back|Version 4.0.1|1
Messages|Love the app with all my heart but it would be better if it would show my messages. It says I have a couple but they won't show up.|Version 4.0.1|4
Love it|I love tumblr. It's easy to work and you get to see so many things on it. Things you have never seen before. Also a pretty rad way to become friends with people of different places|Version 4.0|5
